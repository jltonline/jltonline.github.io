      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Leipzig Germanists <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Fett_Beitraegernamen">Martin Endres</span> and <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Fett_Beitraegernamen">Leonhard Herrmann</span> set an ambitious intellectual agenda for their conference on »Strukturalismus, heute«,
         calling for a reckoning-up of still unpaid or unacknowledged debts to structuralist
         principles in an ostensibly poststructuralist era. What emerged during the course
         of the four-day conference in Hannover (24–27.2.2016) was perhaps even more ambitious:
         a discussion of the complex temporal dynamics of structuralism – as notoriously ahistorical
         method and historically influential movement – that took up the question of structuralisms
         past, present and future. In extending the temporal and disciplinary horizons of the
         investigation, conference participants may have been responding to the latent semantic
         potential in the conference’s title. For »Strukturalismus, heute« can be read several
         ways, and enumerating some of these readings may help sketch out a background for
         the discussion of the conference proceedings that follows. First, »structuralism,
         today« can be understood as a glance backward to an earlier age, a retrospective movement
         along the diachronic axis. From this perspective, a few important dates are worth
         noting: the conference marked the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the posthumous publication of Ferdinand de Saussure’s <span style="font-style:italic">Cours de linguistique générale</span>, structuralism’s founding text, and the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the 8<sup>th</sup> issue of the French journal <span style="font-style:italic">Communications</span>, dedicated to the <span style="font-style:italic">analyse structurale du récit</span>. With essays by Tzvetan Todorov, Roland Barthes, A.J. Greimas, Umberto Eco, Christian
         Metz, and Gérard Genette, its publication marked a watershed moment for structuralist
         literary studies. Second, »structuralism, today« can be understood synchronically,
         as an inventory or snapshot of the present, an overview of contemporary structuralist
         approaches. Finally, »structuralism, today« can be read in the imperative mood, as
         exhortation or demand: <span style="font-style:italic">Structuralism, today!</span> In this regard, the conference title would function as something of a manifesto,
         a call to arms to regain (or simply defend) the disciplinary ground gained by structuralist
         methodology.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">All three of these readings were at work in the talks delivered over four days at
         the <span style="font-style:italic">Schloss Herrenhausen</span> in Hannover, resulting in both a more nuanced historical picture of structuralism
         as movement and a sense of its continued potential as method. Before turning to the
         presentations, however, it is worth saying something about the conference organizer’s
         own temporal positioning of their theme. In their opening remarks, Endres and Herrmann
         characterized the conference – and its concern with structuralism, today – as something
         of a deliberate anachronism: current approaches in the humanities emphasize historicity,
         performance, materiality and dynamics, creating an apparently unfavorable climate
         for structuralism’s suggestion of austere formalism and timeless order. And yet, Herrmann
         and Endres note, a number of structuralist remainders, such as the fundamental distinction
         between sign and signification or the preference for method over subjective intuition,
         persist into an ostensibly poststructuralist present. What is the status of these
         remainders? Are they just that – atavistic remnants which have until now somehow avoided
         the poststructuralist gaze, and hence its critique? Are they instead perhaps revenants,
         structuralist principles whose return signals a growing dissatisfaction with poststructuralist
         theory? Or are they to be understood as elements of a structuralist »inheritance«,
         as foundational – and thus indispensable – assumptions linking structuralism and post-structuralism
         together in an overarching conceptual paradigm? In short, 
         <!--
                       p. -->Herrmann and Endres ask, are we <span style="font-style:italic">still</span> structuralist? Are we <span style="font-style:italic">once again</span> structuralist? Or were we, perhaps, <span style="font-style:italic">always already </span>structuralist?

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">Proceedings </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Speaker substitutions in the lead-up to the conference resulted in a slight deviation
         from the organizer’s original structure, which had grouped presentations thematically
         under the headings »Structure and Sign«, »Structure and Narration«, and »Structure
         and (Digital) Culture«. Fortunately, in the course of the proceedings, a host of both
         overt and subterranean affinities between papers emerged spontaneously, allowing questions
         and concerns from previous talks to serve as points of reference and departure for
         later ones. In an attempt to make visible some of these continuities among papers,
         I have deviated from the chronological order in which participants presented and instead
         gathered their papers into four broad categories according to their primary temporal
         orientation: Genealogies of Structuralism (1), Returns to Structuralism (2), Structuralism
         and Literary-Critical Methods (3) and Contemporary Structuralist Models (4). Naturally,
         there is quite a bit of overlap among these categories, and many talks could be classified
         under two or more headings. In grouping them as I have, my goal has been merely to
         draw out one particular set of affinities, not to give an exhaustive account. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">1. Genealogies of Structuralism. </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Linking the talks in this category is a concern with structuralism as a historical
         phenomenon; presenters offered remarks on the foundation and consolidation of structuralism
         as movement, its conceptual lineage, and its affinities to developments in neighboring
         disciplines. In the conference’s opening presentation, <span style="font-weight:bold">Ludwig Jäger</span> (Köln/Aachen) returned to structuralism’s origins with a provocative question: Did
         Ferdinand de Saussure invent structuralism with his <span style="font-style:italic">Cours de linguistique générale</span>, or is Saussure rather an invention of the <span style="font-style:italic">Cours</span>? In his talk »Begründer oder Erfindung des Strukturalismus? Saussure und der <span style="font-style:italic">Cours de linguistique générale</span>«, Jäger cast a critical eye upon the work done by the <span style="font-style:italic">Cours</span>’ two editors, Saussure’s students Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye. Jäger detailed
         the numerous distortions of Saussure’s thought introduced posthumously by his students,
         including a number of the <span style="font-style:italic">Cours</span>’ best-known statements. Thus, structuralism’s putative origins with Saussure emerge
         as something of an origins myth. Saussure, Jäger argued, would not only have not approved
         of the publication of the <span style="font-style:italic">Cours</span> – he would have even been one of its earliest critics. The second half of Jäger’s
         paper was devoted to four of these major criticisms, pitting the ›Saussure‹ of the
         <span style="font-style:italic">Cours </span>against the <span style="font-style:italic">vrai</span> Saussure on fundamental issues like the form/substance distinction and the relation
         between <span style="font-style:italic">langue/parole</span> (a »dialectical interplay« for the real Saussure, not a distinction between the »essential
         and the incidental«, as one famously reads in the <span style="font-style:italic">Cours</span><span id="Note1_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Saussure, Cours de linguistique générale, Charles Bailly/Albert Séchehaye (eds.), Paris 1967, 30." href="#Note1">[1]</a></span>).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">A further genealogical contribution came from <span style="font-weight:bold">Christian Benne </span>(Copenhagen), whose »Apologie des Buchstaben A. Indogermanistik und Moderne« pursued
         the relation between Saussure’s early work on Indo-European linguistics and his later
         structuralist pursuits. In his talk, Benne traced Saussure’s systematic understanding
         of language as a mutually determining and co-constituting whole (what Saussure, in
         the <span style="font-style:italic">Cours, </span>terms »valeur«<span id="Note2_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. ibid., II.4 “La valeur linguistique”, 155–169." href="#Note2">[2]</a></span>) back to his fascination with the work of early Indo-European scholar Franz Bopp.
         In a further twist, the Idealist overtones in Bopp’s work likely stem from Friedrich
         Schlegel’s 1808 <span style="font-style:italic">Über die Sprache und Weisheit der Indier</span>. Benne then asks whether the later Saussure of the <span style="font-style:italic">Cours </span>does not in fact continue the project of the earlier Indo-Europeanist Saussure – namely,
         the investigation of the relationship between <span style="font-style:italic">son </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">mot </span>and the status of the signifier’s materiality. This interest links him to another
         avid student of Indo-European, a contemporary of Saussure’s also interested in 
         <!--
                       p. -->the relation between sound and word: Stéphane Mallarmé. Affinities between structuralism’s
         scientific aspirations and its artistic echoes were also at the center of <span style="font-weight:bold">Dieter Mersch’s</span> (Zürich) presentation »Strukturale Mathematik und Strukturale Ästhetik. Geschichte
         einer Mésentente«. Mersch began with an overview of the history of mathematics from
         the 17<sup>th</sup> century to the formalist turn around 1900, an attempt to develop a rigorous logical-axiomatical
         foundation that would serve as a ground for future work. Although these attempts foundered
         on various (insoluble) problems of such formalization, their effects and impetus lasted
         well into the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Mersch discussed the history of one of the best-known of these attempts,
         the pseudonymous French collective Nicolas Bourbaki and its attempts to reformulate
         mathematics on a formal and self-contained basis in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century. Numerous personal and conceptual ties linked <span style="font-style:italic">Bourbakisme</span> to the French avant-garde literary group <span style="font-style:italic">Oulipo</span>, <span style="color:252525">whose members employed stringent mathematical formulas and formal constraints to desubjectivize
            their poetic and literary productions. In closing, Mersch noted that the formalist
            turn in mathematics and poetry rested on a double misunderstanding – first on a conception
            of mathematics that placed undue emphasis on its merely mechanical aspects, and then
            on the belief that such a program could or should form the backdrop of a theory of
            literature. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:252525">Eva Geulen’s</span> <span style="color:252525">(Berlin) contribution »Unbekannte Strukturalisten: A. Jolles and G. Kubler« drew out
            of Goethe’s natural-scientific work on comparison and series formation elements of
            proto-structuralist thought. Goethe, Geulen argued, understood series and the underlying
            relations between elements they suggest as always provisional, temporary, open to
            belated modification or reorganization; he systematically resisted or delayed the
            move from a series to a pre-ordained, lawful unity underwriting them. On this basis,
            one could assess other thinkers of seriality and structure – Franco Moretti, D’Arcy
            Thompson, George Kubler and André Jolles – with respect to whether they perceive series
            as essentially pre-ordained (and thus closed) or open and subject to retroactive revision.
            Finally, </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:252525">Nacim Ghanbari </span><span style="color:252525">(Siegen) sketched in her contribution »</span>›<span style="color:252525">Doing Culture</span>‹<span style="color:252525">und die Arbitrarität des Zeichens« the link between contemporary praxeological and
            performative approaches in cultural studies and the structuralist insistence upon
            the arbitrariness of the link between signifier and signified. Although contemporary
            cultural studies has attempted to downplay its linguistic roots, Ghanbari argued that
            the reception of Saussure’s arbitrarity-postulate (through Emile Benveniste, among
            others) was instrumental in allowing scholars of culture to understand important cultural
            institutions – such as gender – as conventionally made and thus modifiable. </span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">2. Returns to Structuralism</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This heading is meant to comprehend talks whose historical dimension consisted in
         returns to or re-readings of key structuralist texts, from Jakobson to Lévi-Strauss.
         <span style="font-weight:bold">Ralf Simon </span>(Basel) offered in his »Was genau heißt: ›Projektion des Äquivalenzprinzips‹? – Roman
         Jakobsons Lehre vom Ähnlichen« a thorough-going reinterpretation of Roman Jakobson’s
         famous definition of the poetic function. The poetic function, Simon argued, consists
         not merely in the quantitatively elevated recurrence or repetition of a paradigm,
         but is rather a principle of transformation that reconfigures all the other functions
         of the linguistic message. Thus, when the poetic function dominates in a message,
         it transforms the message’s addresser- and addressee-functions into complex constructs
         of author and reader, its referential function into one of fictionality, and its metalingual
         function into one of a self-referential immanent poetics. On this reading, Simon argues,
         Jakobson (and his poetic function) emerges as the representative of a more flexible
         eastern European structuralism, distinct from a more rigid western European structuralism
         and already anticipating a number of (western) poststructuralist critiques. A return
         to Jakobson was also at work in <span style="font-weight:bold">Daniel Carranza’s </span>(Chicago) »Rilkes absolute Metapher und die Entarbitrarisierung des Zeichens«. Carranza
         began with Jakobson’s generalization of the 
         <!--
                       p. -->figures of metaphor and metonymy such that they coincide with what had been, since
         Saussure, the two fundamental operations of language – the movement of combination
         (metonymy) along the syntagmatic axis and the movement of selection (metaphor) on
         the paradigmatic axis. Although Jakobson’s move would prove influential for later
         work, it relegated metaphor to the paradigmatic (and thus synchronic) plane and thereby
         failed to account for metaphor’s diachronic elements (above all that of semantic innovation).
         By contrast, Carranza’s theory of the »absolute metaphor« demonstrated a conception
         of metaphor as syntagmatic (and thus temporalized) activity: in the absolute metaphor,
         the reciprocal interaction in time of two semantic fields (those of the metaphor’s
         tenor and vehicle) allows for new semantic potential to emerge. The question of innovation
         in time was also at the center of <span style="font-weight:bold">Jake Fraser</span>’s (Chicago) talk »Irreversibel: Struktur, Prozess, Rekursion«, which investigated
         structuralist resources for thinking the emergence, evolution and differentiation
         of structures. Taking as his point of departure Claude Lévi-Strauss’s reflections
         on the relationship between structure and process in his writings on <span style="font-style:italic">bricolage</span>, Fraser argued that Lévi-Strauss and structuralism more broadly struggled to think
         recursive processes – those capable of revising or rewriting their own structures.
         Tellingly, the famous <span style="font-style:italic">bricoleur </span>of Lévi-Strauss’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Savage Mind </span>is unable to use the tools at hand to develop new tools. Inspiration for a more flexible
         structuralism, Fraser suggested, could be found in cybernetic systems theory, where
         structure is thought operatively, as a resource deployed (and continually revised)
         by self-organizing systems. The issue of revising and refashioning structuralist concepts
         was front and center in <span style="font-weight:bold">Karlheinz Stierle’s </span>(Saarbrücken) presentation »Ist der Strukturalismus überholt? Zur Aktualität einer
         strukturalistischen Literaturwissenschaft«. Stierle suggested that the promise and
         premises of a structuralist literary studies had been abandoned too early, and that
         the approach still offered tremendous potential. One major source of difficulty lay
         in Saussure’s too-sharp distinction between <span style="font-style:italic">langue</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">parole</span>; a structuralist literary studies would have to think the relation between the two
         not just as a <span style="font-style:italic">linguistique de la parole </span>but rather as a unique relationship between system and discourse, code and enunciation.
         A more-nuanced way of thinking this relationship could be found in Merleau-Ponty’s
         writings on language and in speech-act theory, where the tension between individual
         speech acts and social code is thought as a productive source of tension; a structuralism
         which adopted these premises would avoid the traps of Gadamer’s philosophical hermeneutics
         without condemning discourse to the mere realm of the incidental.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">3. Structuralism and Literary-Critical Methods </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Talks in this category shared a concern with structuralism as a disciplinary practice
         and research paradigm. In his talk »Realismus – Historische Aspekte eines Erzählverfahrens«
         <span style="font-weight:bold">Moritz Baßler </span>(Münster) presented the model (and some of the findings) of what he termed a »positivist
         archival structuralism«, a research paradigm which uses structuralist concepts to
         delineate literary styles and epochs. Departing from Jakobson’s remarks on predominantly
         metonymic and metaphoric literary-historical movements (symbolism is essentially metaphoric,
         realism metonymic), Baßler argued that these categorizations apply not to the content
         narrated but to the style of narration. Hence, »realistic« or metonymic narration
         applies equally well to 19<sup>th</sup>-century texts as to the contemporary television series. Further, structuralist analysis
         of innovations in the narrative structures of modern television serials such as »Game
         of Thrones« shows a tendency towards the cutting and recombination of distinct (but
         simultaneous) narrative strands, resulting in the impression that the diegetic world
         is the condition for diegesis and not vice versa. <span style="font-weight:bold">Monika Schmitz-Emans </span>(Bochum) also used structuralist models to theorize new corpora – in her case, collections
         and novels of collecting. Her talk, »Poetiken des Sammelns in der neueren Literatur«,
         took as its basis recent attempts to 
         <!--
                       p. -->think the objects of a collection as signs, which form together a paradigm or code
         and can be arranged syntagmatically. Schmitz-Emans then asked whether, on these grounds,
         collections and collecting could not be understood as narrations and narrating, respectively:
         the addition of an object to an existing collection would expand both the paradigm
         and the syntagma. Such an understanding, she showed, does seem to exist – both in
         museum exhibitions dedicated to »speaking« things and the books or texts that accompanied
         them. <span style="font-weight:bold">Hannah Eldridge</span>’s (Madison) presentation »Einsetzung metrischer Zeichen: Durs Grünbeins physiologische
         Poetik« moved in the opposite direction: she asked about the extent to which contemporary
         cognitivist and neuroscientific approaches to poetics recall structuralism’s promise
         to lend scientific rigor to literary study. However, encounters between science and
         literature have tended to look more like confrontation than collaboration – whether
         in the contributions to the 1958 conference »<span style="font-style:italic">Style in Language</span>« (where Jakobson claimed that poetics was a subfield of linguistics) or in current
         work on cognitive aesthetics and evocriticism. Eldridge then turned to contemporary
         German poet Durs Grünbein to display some of the ambivalences and contradictions that
         result from this confrontation: Grünbein at one and the same time takes natural-scientific
         concepts and structures as the basis for his thought and poetics, while at the same
         time criticizing the reductionism of natural scientific thought. <span style="font-weight:bold">Andreas Ohme </span>(Jena) similarly drew attention to contemporary methodological trends. In his »Beschreiben
         oder Bewerten? Zur Relevanz des strukturalistischen Paradigmas«, he delivered an impassioned
         plea for literary studies to not lose the precision and clarity with respect to delineating
         and describing its object that structuralist methods had provided—a danger posed,
         for example, by poststructuralist narratologies that have traded conceptual precision
         for expanded considerations of works’ context and thematic content. <span style="font-weight:bold">Nicole Sütterlin</span> (Cambridge), by contrast, embraced poststructuralist narrative theory in her »Untod
         des Autors. Poststrukturalistisches Erzählen nach der Wende«. Taking Roland Barthes’
         famous essay on the »death of the author« literally, Sütterlin built on previous work
         on the novel ›after theory‹ with a study of novels whose narrators perform their death,
         speaking from beyond the grave. Sütterlin’s reading of Marcel Beyer’s <span style="font-style:italic">Das Menschenfleisch </span>demonstrated amongst other things an attempt to pair poststructuralist claims about
         the materiality of the signifier with the literalization of poststructuralist figures
         of thought, such that intertextuality comes to resemble a form of cannibalism.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">4. Contemporary Structuralist Models </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The talks grouped together in this heading generally attempted systematic or historical
         overviews of a field or approach, ranging from narratology to media semiotics. As
         such, they are somewhat difficult to summarize in the format of conference proceedings,
         and my accounts of their content unfortunately can only gesture towards their complexity.
         <span style="font-weight:bold">Benjamin Specht</span> (Stuttgart) took the tale of the prodigal son from the <span style="font-style:italic">Gospel of Luke</span> as the basis for demonstrating a theory of literary semantics. How, Specht asks,
         can the already significant elements of a narrative (their ›authentic‹ meaning) acquire
         a collective, secondary or ›inauthentic‹ [uneigentlich] meaning, in addition to their
         literal significance? In proceeding, Specht delineated four forms of this relationship
         between authentic and inauthentic meaning: analogical, allegorical, parable-like,
         and ambiguous [vieldeutig]. The tale of the prodigal son, Specht argued, can be read
         as embodying each of the four forms, suggesting a co-constitution of text through
         reader. <span style="font-weight:bold">Michael Scheffel </span>(Wuppertal) offered in his talk »Narratologie – eine aus dem Geist des Strukturalismus
         geborene Disziplin?« an overview of the various formalist and structuralist schools
         that had contributed to contemporary narratological thought. The wide range of schools
         and methods that have all attempted to develop a systematic account of narration –
         from folklore studies to Russian formalism, from French structuralism to post-war
         
         <!--
                       p. -->German thought – meant, Scheffel cautioned, that there is neither one structuralism
         nor one theory of narrative, but rather a number of competing forms. <span style="font-weight:bold">Andreas Blödorn </span>(Münster) and <span style="font-weight:bold">Jan-Oliver Decker </span>(Passau) also delivered historical overviews of structuralist approaches in their
         fields (film studies and media semiotics, respectively). Blödorn (»Strukturalistische
         Ansätze in der Filmanalyse«) detailed the difficulties faced by structuralist and
         semiotic approaches in film studies in locating smallest significant units for analysis,
         suggesting that perhaps movement could form the basis for a new film semiotics. Decker’s
         talk (»Strukturalistische Ansätze in der Mediensemiotik«) presented an overview of
         the <span style="font-style:italic">Passau school</span>of media semiotics, demonstrating how semiotic models from Lotman could be used to
         understand the productive exchanges between the center and periphery of a semiosphere:
         fan fiction for mass-culture phenomena like <span style="font-style:italic">The Lord of the Rings </span>allowed peripheral users to modify semantic codes, producing effects that then made
         their way back to the center. <span style="font-weight:bold">Marianne Wünsch </span>(Kiel) provided, in addition to a schematic account of structuralist and semiotic
         approaches in literary studies, a methodological critique of cultural studies [Kulturwissenschaft]
         in her talk »Strukturalismus; Literaturwissenschaft – Medienwissenschaft – Kulturwissenschaft«:
         lacking a discipline-specific object or research methodology meant that <span style="font-style:italic">Kulturwissenschaft</span> had no claims to the disciplinary status of a science [Wissenschaftlichkeit]. <span style="font-weight:bold">Alexander Becker </span>(Düsseldorf), finally, presented in his »Bemerkungen zur Bedeutung der Struktur in
         und für die Sprache aus sprachanalytischer Sicht« a perspective on linguistic structure
         from the standpoint of contemporary analytic philosophy. Structure, on this account,
         is what allows sentences to have meanings that transcend the mere enumeration of their
         parts, and thus allows them to be true or false: sentences without structure are neither
         true nor meaningful sentences, but rather lists. One consequence of this link between
         meaning and structure is, Becker argued, that our access to the world is unavoidably
         shaped by language.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">Conclusion</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the wrap-up discussion that followed the conference’s final presentation, two issues
         emerged as both central points of concern for participants and open questions going
         forward. Opening the floor, Herrmann expressed his surprise that the most pressing
         concern of structuralism seemed to be not that of sign systems or semiotics, but rather
         structuralism itself, insofar as structuralism and structure had emerged as unsettled
         epistemological and ontological problems. »Gibt es Strukturen« Herrmann asked, »oder
         sind sie heuristische Postulate, die im Akt des Beobachtens entstehen?« – a question
         which could not help but recall Saussure’s despair upon discovering that the ›hidden‹
         anagrams he was finding in Latin texts were perhaps <span style="font-style:italic">too </span>easy to find, and thus »fantasmagorie«.<span id="Note3_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Saussure qtd. in Starobinski, Les mots sous les mots. Les anagrammes de Ferdinand de Saussure, Paris 1971, 138. See also Jonathan Culler, Ferdinand d…" href="#Note3">[3]</a></span> One way of overcoming the apparent opposition would be to reframe it as a problem
         of attribution: a more precise structuralism would perhaps need to distinguish between
         structures of production, structures of texts, and structures of reception. This would
         pose in turn the question of structure and function – once one raises the question
         of the location of structure (in the author, in the reader, in the text), structuralist
         theory must contend both with the possibility of multiple structures active simultaneously
         as well as the possibility that structures differ qualitatively with respect to their
         function.<span id="Note4_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Niklas Luhmann distinguishes between structures of (re-)production and structures of description in Soziale Systeme, Frankfurt am Main 1984, 382–387." href="#Note4">[4]</a></span> Another way of answering (or at least addressing) the question would be Foucauldian:
         yes, structures exist, insofar as they are anchored in historical constellations of
         institutions, regimes of knowledge, concrete practices of reading, writing and philology,
         networks of exchange amongst scholars, etc. From this perspective, one would substitute
         for a history of structuralism a genealogy of structures.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">A second, related focus of the discussion was the question of structuralism as method.
         Structuralism, it was observed, is and was both a universalizing theory with tremendous
         capacities for abstraction as well as a heuristic practice that made new entities,
         relations, and 
         <!--
                       p. -->corpora visible for literary scholars. In this regard, one might think of influential
         early works of French structuralism like Lévi-Strauss’s »The Structural Study of Myth«
         and Barthes’ <span style="font-style:italic">Système de la mode</span>, whose imbrication of theoretical speculation and critical interpretive practice
         is such that one is perhaps justified in speaking of ›concrete theory‹ or (to blend
         the terms and fields that Barthes was still attempting to distinguish in his <span style="font-style:italic">Critique et verité</span>) »scientific criticism«. From this, however, emerges a series of questions concerning
         the relationship between structuralism and the ›scientific‹ study of literature: are
         there other, alternative but still scientific methods of studying literature? If so,
         what might they look like? If not, what happens to the specificity of structuralism
         as a movement or concept – can it still be distinguished from a general impulse toward
         the scientific study of literature?
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Addressing these two broader areas of concern – the nature and location of structure,
         the question of method and practice – may require returning to (and perhaps rethinking)
         the relationship between structuralism and semiotics. Certainly one view of structuralism
         today, borne out by official histories and underwritten by a founding dictum (Saussure’s
         testamentary assertion that linguistics would someday be but one branch of a broader
         semiology that studied the social use of signs<span id="Note5_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="See Saussure, Cours de linguistique générale, Charles Bailly/Albert Séchehaye (eds.), Paris 1967, 33 (»Place de la langue dans les faits humains. La …" href="#Note5">[5]</a></span>), would suggest that semiotics is the proper heir of and to structuralism – a view
         in evidence when conference participants used ›sign system‹ [Zeichensystem] as a synonym
         for ›structure‹. And yet, the all but total eclipse of semiotics by poststructuralism<span id="Note6_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Although the disciplinary fate of semiotics obviously varies by country (on this, see Thomas A. Sebeok/Jean Umiker-Sebeok (eds.), The Semiotic Sphere…" href="#Note6">[6]</a></span> suggests that the resources required to respond to poststructuralist critique may
         lie not in a general theory of signs, but rather in notions of structure compatible
         with the poststructuralist emphasis on the material, the historical, and the non-hermeneutic.<span id="Note7_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="On the post-hermeneutic turn, see (still) David Wellbery’s foreword to the English translation of Friedrich Kittler’s, Discourse Networks, Stanford 1…" href="#Note7">[7]</a></span> Hence, a different take on structuralism today might look to the conference’s genealogies
         of structuralism for alternative conceptions of structure: in morphology and D’Arcy
         Thompson’s biological structuralism, in Shannon and Weaver’s cybernetics, information
         and systems theory, and in Bourbaki’s structural mathematics.<span id="Note8_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="One node in which all three of these alternative structuralisms coincide is Claude Lévi-Strauss. During his time in New York in the 1940s, Lévi-Strau…" href="#Note8">[8]</a></span> Structuralism today – which is to say, a contemporary structuralism, a structuralism
         of and for the future – may require a detour through structuralisms past.

               never came to fruition. On the relation between structuralism, poststructuralism and
               semiotics in the American context, see Peter Brooks’ account of his experiences with

               as well as in early cybernetics, information and systems theory. The latter passion
               he shared with Roman Jakobson, Émile Benveniste and Jacques Lacan. Upon his return

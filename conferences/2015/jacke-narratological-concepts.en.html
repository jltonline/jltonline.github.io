      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Titel_Rezension">Narratological Concepts and Interpretation</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">1st Philosophy meets Literary Studies Workshop, University of Hamburg, December 12–13,
         2014.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">1. Motivation and Idea</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">With the rise of narratology during the 20th century narratological concepts such
         as <span style="font-style:italic">narrator</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">fictional world</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">plot</span> have become increasingly important tools for approaching literary texts. However,
         research over the past decades has substantiated the suspicion that many narratological
         concepts are ill-understood.<span id="Note1_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="A pertinent example is the criticism launched against one of the fundamental assumptions of literary theory, viz. that every fictional narrative has …" href="#Note1">[1]</a></span> Thus, it is one of the most pressing desiderata of literary studies to improve the
         understanding of narratological notions. Ways of doing so include giving precise definitions,
         scrutinizing application conditions, and investigating the structure of narratological
         concepts by specifying which notions are fundamental and which are derivative.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Relatedly, the interdependencies between narratological concepts and interpretation
         remain to be clarified. It is often presumed that narratological concepts are neutral
         with respect to interpretation in at least two ways: (i) they can be invoked by any
         school of interpretation and (ii) applying them is not an interpretative move.<span id="Note2_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cp. Tom Kindt/Hans-Harald Müller, Narrative Theory and/or/as Theory of Interpretation, in idem (eds.): What Is Narratology? Questions and Answers Reg…" href="#Note2">[2]</a></span> These assumptions, however, have been challenged.<span id="Note3_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Skeptical accounts are often linked to the position of cognitive narratology (cp. David Herman, D.: Cognitive Narratology, in Peter Hühn et al. (eds.…" href="#Note3">[3]</a></span> It is therefore time to reassess how narratology relates to interpretation.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Since all of the above is essentially conceptual work it is natural to seek support
         from experts in dealing with concepts. Analytic philosophy seems particularly apt
         because it provides powerful tools and methodological means to guide and focus the
         envisaged research. Moreover, analytic aesthetics already offers decades of research
         relating to the foundations of literary theory.<span id="Note4_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Pertinent philosophical research primarily concerns (i) the concept of fiction, (ii) the semantics and pragmatics of fictional and metafictional disc…" href="#Note4">[4]</a></span> However, exchange between the disciplines has been rather modest. This may be, in
         part, due to the fact that philosophical research is often ignorant of the needs,
         insights and theoretical frameworks of literary studies. The result is rather unfortunate.
         Frequently, philosophers do not capture the concepts literary scholars are after.
         And even if they do, their results cannot be put to use when interpreting literary
         texts.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The idea of the workshop <span style="font-style:italic">Narratological Concepts and Interpretation</span> was to support ongoing endeavors of shedding light on narratological concepts and
         interpretation by bringing literary scholars and philosophers who work on these issues
         together. Contributions were supposed to tackle either particular narratological concepts
         or more general issues concerning interpretation, narratology or the relationship
         between these two. The long-term goal of the organizers (Christian Folde, PhD student
         in philosophy, and Janina Jacke, PhD student in literary studies) is to promote cooperation
         and exchange between philosophy and literary studies. In particular, the organizers
         hope to launch a series of workshops concerning issues at the intersection of the
         two disciplines.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The workshop took place from December 12th-13th at the University of Hamburg and was
         sponsored by PHLOX, a philosophical research group headed by Prof. Benjamin Schnieder,
         and heureCLÉA, a literary studies project led by Prof. Jan Christoph Meister. Speakers
         included (in order of appearance): Prof. Tilmann Köppe, Dr. Christiana Werner, Dr.
         Stacie Friend, Dr. Thomas Petraschka, and Prof. Peter Lamarque. In the following,
         we will give a brief summary of each talk and appendant discussion. We conclude by
         indicating how our idea of pooling philosophers and literary scholars panned out.

                       p. -->2. Köppe on Narrative Closure
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In his talk »Narrative Closure« <span style="font-weight:bold">Tilmann Köppe</span> (Göttingen) primarily addressed the difficulties in defining the narratological concept
         of narrative closure – roughly, the property of stories to have a proper ending. Different
         approaches to the phenomenon indicate that there are no shared intuitions concerning
         both concrete cases and the grounds for classification (textual features vs. response-dependence).
         However, the project of defining narrative closure can still be of some use since
         it can provide important insights concerning the phenomenon. In the remaining part
         of the talk, Köppe analyzed a definition proposed by Noël Carroll. According to Carroll,
         a narrative exhibits narrative closure if and only if it evokes in its informed reader
         a feeling of finality which is brought about if and only if the reader realizes that
         all presiding macro-questions posed by the plot of the narrative have been answered.
         The main challenges of this approach include (i) that readers’ feelings of closure
         do not necessarily coincide with questions being answered, (ii) that plot and/or macro-questions
         are difficult to identify, and (iii) that it leaves open the question of whether closure
         is a gradable phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">One of the issues in the discussion was the question what exactly the bearer of the
         property of narrative closure is: the narrative, the plot, or something else. It was
         also questioned whether all fictional narratives exhibit closure (alleged counterexample:
         Beckett), and whether closure is not a phenomenon in non-fictional narratives and
         in music, too. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">3. Werner on Emotions towards Fictional Characters</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Christiana Werner</span>’s (Göttingen) talk »The problem with <span style="font-style:italic">The Purple Rose of Cairo</span>: fictional characters as intentional objects of emotions« focused on the question
         of how the fact that we can have emotions towards fictional characters affects theories
         of emotions and ontological accounts of fictional characters. Werner started by describing
         the so called paradox of fiction which arises from the following three assumptions:
         (i) the emotions a person S experiences towards fictional characters are genuine (Response
         Condition), (ii) does not believe that fictional characters exist (Belief Condition),
         and (iii) in order to have genuine emotions towards objects of a kind k one has to
         believe that objects of kind k exist (Coordination Condition). There are several solution
         strategies to the paradox discussed in the literature. Werner focused on three of
         them: (a) accept all three claims but assume that S’s emotions towards fictional characters
         are inconsistent (Radford), (b) reject the Response Condition and argue that the emotions
         S has towards fictional characters are not genuine but quasi-emotions (Walton), and
         (c) deny the Belief Condition by accepting a popular version of fictional realism,
         viz. that fictional objects exist and that they are abstract, i.e. non-spatial, artefacts.
         According to Werner, neither of these solutions is convincing. Radford’s approach
         classifies too many of our emotions as irrational. Walton’s approach presupposes intentional
         pretense of our emotions towards fictional characters, which contradicts our experience.
         Fictional realism, finally, needs to explain how fictional entities – conceived of
         as abstract objects – can be intentional objects of emotions.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Among other things the discussion addressed the idea that rationality does not necessarily
         seem to be an adequate requirement for emotions in the first place. However, Werner
         pointed out that some component theories of emotions take beliefs to be components
         of emotions, which makes irrationality a possible feature of emotions.

         <!--
                       p. -->4. Friend on Truth in Fiction
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The second day of the workshop started with <span style="font-weight:bold">Stacie Friend</span>’s (London) talk »Realism and Reality«. Friend addressed the problem of truth in fiction
         by defending the reality principle (or: principle of minimal departure). As is well
         known, what is true in a story – roughly, what a work of fiction authorizes us to
         imagine – exceeds what is explicitly stated in the text. Friend’s basic idea is that
         stories, whether fiction or non-fiction, invite us to imagine about the real world.
         The naïve reality principle has it that everything that is actually true is true in
         a story. Obviously, this needs refinements since what is explicitly true in a story
         may contradict reality. The standard formulation respects this requirement by invoking
         a counterfactual: given all explicit story truths p<sub>1</sub>-p<sub>n</sub>, something q is true in a story if and only if, were it the case that p<sub>1</sub>-p<sub>n</sub>, then it would be the case that q.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">However, according to Friend, this formulation is too strong because primary story
         truths are not the only reason for departure from reality. Her modified principle
         of reality reads: given all explicit story truths p<sub>1</sub>-p<sub>n</sub>, something q is true in a story if and only if, if it was the case that p<sub>1</sub>-p<sub>n</sub>, then it would be the case that q, <span style="font-style:italic">except if a correct interpretation of the work requires otherwise</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Her arguments in favor of the reality principle included empirical evidence that knowledge
         about the real world actually plays an important role when interpreting story worlds.
         Friend closed her talk by defending the principle against several objections and came
         to the conclusion that the reality principle, in comparison with alternative principles,
         has the most accurate scope in identifying story truths. Thus, it not only describes
         the actual practice of interpreting story worlds, but can also be taken as a normative
         guideline to interpretation.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In discussing the question of how knowledge on story worlds can be acquired the talk
         gave important insights on the relation between narratological <span style="font-style:italic">histoire</span>-concepts and interpretation. However, one important weakness of Friend’s account
         was pointed out in the discussion: the exception clause Friend added to her version
         of the reality principle (»except if a correct interpretation of the work states otherwise«)
         makes it virtually invulnerable to counter-examples.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1" lang="de" translate="no">5. Petraschka on Intentions and Interpretation</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Thomas Petraschka’s (Regensburg) opened his talk »On categorial and semantic intentions
         and on their relevance for interpretation, theory of fiction and narratology« by elaborating
         on Levinson’s distinction between semantic intentions – what meaning does the author
         wish to express with his text? – and categorial intentions – what type of text does
         the author wish to produce? According to Petraschka the distinction is problematic
         since two commonly given distinctive criteria do not seem to hold: neither are categorial
         intentions infallibly instantiated nor can they be infallibly identified. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the second part of his talk Petraschka criticized Levinson’s proposal that <span style="font-style:italic">actual</span> intentionalism should be applied to identify the text type whereas <span style="font-style:italic">hypothetical</span> intentionalism helps identify the meaning of a text. Since we cannot clearly distinguish
         between semantic and categorical intentions Levinson’s proposal has to be rejected.
         In addition, the distinction seems unfit to solve the main problem of actual intentionalism:
         the fact that the implementation of intentions in a text can fail.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->The discussion focused on the question what exactly categorical intentions are (are
         they Gricean?) and whether they are sufficient for the determination of a text type
         (what about standard and non-standard features?). In additio<a id="_DdeLink__1587_46720687">
            <!--anchor--></a>n, categorical intentions seem to play different roles in determining whether something
         is an artwork, a work of fiction, or of a particular genre.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">6. Lamarque on The Opacity of Narrative</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The final talk of the workshop was given by <span style="font-weight:bold">Peter Lamarque</span> (York) on »Interpretation and the Opacity of Narrative«. By the opacity of narrative
         Lamarque points to the characteristic of narratives that the represented world is
         inseparable from the way in which it is presented. This includes referential opacity
         (i.e. the idea that substitution of co-extensional terms changes the content of a
         narrative) as well as representational opacity (i.e., the idea that if a fictional
         narrative represents an object a, and a is identical to b, it does not represent b).
         Narratives aim at representation instead of being merely the end product of a causal
         process (like photographs). However, opacity – at least in the former sense – is not
         an intrinsic feature of literary narratives. Instead, the question of whether form
         and content are inseparable depends on the interests brought to the text: we decide
         to read for opacity when we lay emphasis on the way in which narrative content is
         presented. In the remaining part of his talk, Lamarque used a scene from Jane Eyre
         to demonstrate how reading for opacity can not only bring out the brilliance of a
         literary work and heighten our reading pleasure, but also helps us <span style="font-style:italic">interpret</span> literature in the way that it makes us explore ways of reflecting on the fictional
         world and heightens our experience of that world.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">It was pointed out in the discussion that if we read for opacity then the exact linguistic
         wording may matter. Consequently, even a translation of a poem, say, into another
         language would result in there being two different literary works. In contrast to
         literature scientific prose must be transparent: if the enterprise of science is to
         work, then there have to be different ways of saying the same thing (in the same as
         well as in other languages).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">7. Conclusion</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Judging from its content the workshop succeeded in collecting some perspectives from
         philosophy and literary studies on narratological concepts and interpretation. However,
         the workshop was not as thematically focused as one might have wished. Moreover, all
         talks were more on the philosophical side of things – a genuine literary studies perspective
         in terms of historical surveys or literary interpretations was lacking. All contributions
         focused on the theory of fiction in the wide sense and can be characterized as more
         or less analytically aesthetic. At the same time the shared common theoretical background
         resulted in informed and lively discussions. This is not to be expected in general
         when philosophers and literary scholars come together and exchange ideas about common
         issues. In fact, we suspect that the selection of speakers greatly helped to enable
         a smooth exchange between disciplines without fundamental differences in methodology.
         Putting this consensus into question could be a possibility for a future workshop.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The workshop very much focused on theory. Many literary scholars, however, look for
         applications of theory in their everyday work. Having this practical perspective on
         board would certainly be a desideratum for workshops to come.

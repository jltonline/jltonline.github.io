      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch" lang="de" translate="no">Poetik der Gattungsmischung / Poetics of Genre Blending. International Conference
         at Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg im Breisgau, in cooperation with Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität
         Munich. March 27 – March 29, 2014.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Organizers <span style="font-weight:bold">Sylvia Brockstieger </span>(Freiburg) and <span style="font-weight:bold">Cornelia Rémi </span>(München) opened the conference with a comprehensive overview of various theoretical
         approaches towards genre blending. They proposed a tentative terminological and methodological
         matrix for analyzing generically hybrid texts, starting from the general difficulties
         faced by genre theorists. The phenomena of genre blending and genre hybrids challenge
         the notion of distinct genres as supra-historical entities; rather than that, genres
         need to be treated as flexible categories shaped by the aesthetic and social needs
         of different agents in the literary field. A theory of genre blending and its historical
         development must therefore tackle a set of key questions, among them: Which aspects
         of a generic profile are attached to the hybrid ›third‹ – and how? Which criteria
         can we use to distinguish between different varieties or grades of blending – phenomena
         like intertextuality, intermediality, shifting ›modes of writing‹ (<span style="font-style:italic">Schreibweisen</span>), and genre hybridity?
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Based on a framework provided by several theorists elaborating on questions of generic
         hybridity (Genette, Pfister, Seibel), Brockstieger and Rémi proposed a series of heuristic
         categories which allow for identifying such hybridity as well as account for the supposed
         processual character of genre blending in the interaction of its four communicative
         components: <span style="font-style:italic">text</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">author</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">reader</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic">context</span>. The extent of genre blending may be determined by analyzing the <span style="font-style:italic">text</span> itself. Focussing on the <span style="font-style:italic">author</span> reveals aspects of a specific genre consciousness, which might influence a generic
         design, while taking the <span style="font-style:italic">reader</span>/<span style="font-style:italic">recipient</span> into account aims at uncovering conventional patterns of reception as well as cognitive
         aspects of the reading process. Finally, the <span style="font-style:italic">context </span>encompasses pragmatic, social, institutional and literary background conditions. Consequently,
         a communication-oriented theory of genre blending cannot function without a deep understanding
         of the respective historical setting, a precept which proved to be essential in all
         presentations and discussions throughout the conference.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Accordingly, Rémi and Brockstieger illustrated and expanded on central features of
         this model. Rémi demonstrated the importance of conceptualizing the reader in order
         to grasp the historical significance of genre blending by examining Friedrich Spielhagen’s
         interpretation of Vischer’s <span style="font-style:italic">Auch Einer</span>, while Brockstieger referred to the Baroque tragicomedy <span style="font-style:italic">Cenodoxus</span> for pointing out how even a relatively established hybrid genre must be densely contextualized
         in order to determine its functions and achievements. In the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Cenodoxus</span>, its hybrid construction reflects the early modern perception of human life and,
         thus, caters to specific socio-cultural needs.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Based on models from the field of cognitive science (e. g. Fauconnier, Turner, Sinding),<span style="font-weight:bold">Rüdiger Zymner</span> (Wuppertal) offered a different theoretical approach by proposing to understand »Genre
         Blending as <span style="font-style:italic">Conceptual Blending</span>«. This approach perceives literary genres as stable mental meta-representations,
         so-called ›mental spaces‹. The term ›conceptual blending‹ refers to a cognitive operation
         which, by merging such <span style="font-style:italic">mental spaces</span>, results in a third, <span style="font-style:italic">blended space</span>, perceived as a mixture of genres. However, this purely cognition-based model does
         not 
         <!--
                       p. -->explain what motivates the genesis of <span style="font-style:italic">mental</span> and thus<span style="font-style:italic">blended spaces</span>. Zymner therefore presented some additional pragmatic considerations that might help
         to deal with this problem. He proposed to distinguish between socio-cultural norms
         of communication that shape our genre consciousness and their phonetic as well as
         graphemic representations. Moreover, he argued for applying the term <span style="font-style:italic">Gattungsmischung</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">genre blending</span>) only when the blending is communicated explicitly by the text as opposed to cases
         of generic vagueness or multi-generic texts. In that sense, strong genre blending
         occurs when the original generic terms remain visible within the ›new name‹ (e.g.
         tragicomedy), whereas weak genre blending is marked by adjectival modification of
         a conventional genre (e.g. lyric drama, epic poem).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In his talk »Genre-mixture in Rhetorics«<span style="font-style:italic">,</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">Dietmar Till </span>(Tübingen) discussed the question of possible forms of genre blending in public speeches.
         Following a diachronic approach, Till first introduced the three Aristotelian genres
         (deliberative, judicial and epideictic speech) and their ›career‹ within ancient rhetorical
         theory. Using four examples from late antiquity up until present-day political discourse,
         he illustrated the astonishing continuity and normativity of said ancient genres.
         Consequently, genre blending occurs as a more or less marked, but in any case intentional
         contamination of two (or possibly more) genres. Ludwig Uhland, for instance, added
         a highly political subtext to an epideictic speech in honour of the newly elected
         Landtag of Tübingen by deliberately blending the two traditional genres. In the case
         of Marcel Reich-Ranicki's famed speech remembering the victims of National Socialism
         in 2012, Till demonstrated how the communicative context of a speech is crucial for
         its genre allocation. Thus, Reich-Ranicki’s reading of a narrative autobiographic
         text was perceived as a commemorative speech by the audience.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Jan Stenger </span>(Glasgow) posed the question to what extent the popular view of the late antiquity
         as a ›period of blending genres‹ (Charlet) is justified. In his talk »Genre Blending
         as Signature of an Era? Critical Reflections on the Literary Physiognomy of Late Antiquity«,
         Stenger discussed Herzog’s assumption that a distinct aesthetic paradigm is effective
         in the literature of late antiquity – a paradigm that encompasses playing on traditional
         forms and partially forfeiting traditional genre rules. Nevertheless, numerous texts
         used to obey these rules continuously, an observation which prompted Stenger to advise
         against generalizing the albeit significant phenomenon emphasized by Herzog. Furthermore,
         he criticized Herzog’s indistinct and also a-historical genre concept that inevitably
         leads to a less concise notion of genre blending, resulting from a supposed deviation
         from the classical norm. In contrast, Stenger argued for the supposed incommensurability
         of the era, when mimesis could not be regarded as a leading category any longer. Bible
         exegesis along with its new hermeneutic techniques presented an analytical approach
         towards literature and paved the path towards new modes of its perception. Stenger
         identified possible focal points of further research on genre blending in late antiquity.
         Amongst other things, he asked which aspects of a polyvalent text might then be able
         to take the place of the category ›genre‹.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Beate Langenbruch</span> (Lyon) discussed »The Generic Laboratory of the French Middle Ages«, in the sense
         that producers and recipients of (French) medieval literature can be perceived as
         ›working‹ together in creating new literary forms while being exposed to various external
         cultural influences. Langenbruch demonstrated the co-presence of factual and fictional
         (Jean Bodel), of sacred and profane (Jean de Meung), of creation and reception, of
         different media and arts (text and picture, music, dance, game) and of different ›genres‹
         (Jean Renart; Charles d’Orléans). In doing so, she underpinned the general medieval
         tendency towards hybridity and disorder, which derived from specific cultural and
         historical preconditions: With the French language having only recently emerged from
         Celtic, Romanic and Germanic influences, the linguistic material was far from being
         homogeneous. Moreover, strong genre consciousness, being linked to stable poetical
         rules, was also lacking. Although ancient genre concepts were 
         <!--
                       p. -->still prevalent in the sphere of the clergy, the face of vernacular literature was
         mainly shaped by the practical needs of its audience, i.e. by oral or performative
         contexts. The hybrids resulting from these conditions could either take on long ›generic‹
         lives of their own or dissolve after not being ›needed‹ any more. The genre <span style="font-style:italic">miracle play</span> (»Mirakelspiel«) from the 14<sup>th</sup> century, for instance, merged sermon as well as theater and arose from the collective
         singing of the <span style="font-style:italic">Te Deum</span> by the audience and the preacher. After a short bloom it vanished into insignificance.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Michael Waltenberger</span> (Frankfurt a. M.) talked about »Heterogeneity in Gautier’s and Otte’s <span style="font-style:italic">Eraclius</span>« and claimed that Otte’s treatment of the subject matter is not to be read as a reflexion
         on genres, but as a manifestation of disorder: The intertextual reference to the French
         version of Gautier d’Arras evokes the ›generic domains‹ of legend and heroic life,
         but farcical traits and adolescence motives break down that generic frame as soon
         as it emerges. The result radicalizes the already ambiguous characteristics of Gauthier’s
         text, an episodic work meant to be read less in a biographical, but rather in an eschatological
         way. While (early) modern phenomena of genre blending can assume poetological meaning,
         medieval ›blended‹ texts call for a historical reading to avoid misinterpretation.
         The textual traits which we perceive as ›blended‹, ›hybrid‹ or ›mixed‹ must have appeared
         less strange to Otte’s contemporaries. Thus, medieval generic disorder is the result
         of vibrant literary production without institutions.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In his talk on »Hybridity as a Catalyst for the Development of the German Novel in
         the Late Middle Age«, <span style="font-weight:bold">Stefan Seeber</span> (Freiburg) showed how theories from the field of cultural studies like Bachtin’s
         concept of hybridity, the idea of the third space from translation theory, and Bhabha’s
         staircase motive can be applied to medieval and early modern novels in order to conceptualize
         their hybrid genre status. With the middle ages lacking a strong generic consciousness
         in general, ›the novel‹ would respond to a multitude of influences and reinvent itself
         constantly, sanctioned only by its audiences. According to Seeber, ›genre blending‹
         is an operation acted out by the reader who either combines heterogeneous elements
         in a third space himself (Johann’s von Würzburg <span style="font-style:italic">Wilhelm von Österreich</span>) or reproduces the synthesis already performed in the text (<span style="font-style:italic">Magelone</span>). Seeber distinguished between <span style="font-style:italic">unintentional hybridity</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">unterlaufene Hybridität) </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">intentional-artificial hybridity (intentional-artifizielle Hybridität)</span>, a distinction again produced by the reader.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Key-note speaker <span style="font-weight:bold">Klaus Garber</span> (Osnabrück) gave an instructive overview of the long cultural history of the shepherd
         and the various forms of »Genre Blending in Pastoral Poetry«. The ancient figure of
         the shepherd proves to be a <span style="font-style:italic">wanderer between genres</span> throughout the history of occidental literature. He is characterized as a virtuous
         creature of nature and, apart from always speaking in verses, eludes attribution to
         a fixed genre. Garber traced the shepherd’s generic transformation from his origin
         in Theokrit and his elaboration in Virgil over the differentiation of the motif in
         the Renaissance, its (political) reinterpretation in England and in Opitz’s work up
         to Gessner’s <span style="font-style:italic">Idyllen</span> in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. Approaching his subject from the perspective of the history of ideas, Garber
         proposed that genres die out when they do not correspond to the needs of their time,
         and thus new genres arise. The discussion raised the question if hybrid genres in
         general had a liability towards unfruitfulness.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">On the second day, <span style="font-weight:bold">Simon Zeisberg </span>(Berlin) reflected on the »Poetics of Genre Blending in the Exposition to Grimmelshausen’s
         <span style="font-style:italic">Simplicissimus</span>«<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>He discussed poetological concepts presented in the first chapter of the novel and
         emphasized the influence of contemporary theoretical discourses that gave rise to
         the meta-poetical architectural metaphors to which Grimmelshausen’s text refers. <span style="font-style:italic">Simplicissimus</span> combines elements of the <span style="font-style:italic">genus grande</span> and of the <span style="font-style:italic">genus humile</span>; its chronological and homodiegetical organization associates <span style="font-style:italic">ordo naturalis, </span>while heterodiegetical elements allude on <span style="font-style:italic">ordo artificiosus</span>. By blending both tendencies, the novel complicates its own reception and evokes
         implicit criticism of the norms of the ›courteous 
         <!--
                       p. -->novel‹. This blending technique is being reflected on especially in said first chapter
         of <span style="font-style:italic">Simplicissimus </span>(<span style="font-style:italic">Spessarter Haushalt</span>), by visualizing the text itself as either household (<span style="font-style:italic">oeconomia</span>) or a building. By juxtaposing palace and straw hut Grimmelshausen evokes two genres
         and creates a third space of hybridity, which requests new patterns of reception and
         implements a new empirical world view beyond <span style="font-style:italic">ordo naturalis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">ordo artificiosus</span>. Nevertheless, the generic distinction remains visible in the realm of hybridity
         and ultimately questions the conditions of narration.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Jörg Robert</span> (Tübingen) was the first speaker to interpret the hybrid character of a text as psychological
         evidence regarding the author’s voice. In his talk »Hybrid Petrarchism: Genre Blending
         in J.M.R. Lenz’s Epic Poem <span style="font-style:italic">Petrarch – Ein Gedicht aus seinen Liedern gezogen</span> (1776)« he characterized Lenz’s <span style="font-style:italic">Petrach </span>as a hybrid uniting elements of Petrarch’s poetry, Goethe’s <span style="font-style:italic">Werther</span> and Wieland’s irony, a combination which in Robert’s opinion ultimately reflects
         Lenz’s own unhappy love of Goethe’s sister. Petrarch’s unfulfilled love of Laura serves
         as an epigonal camouflage for Lenz’s own misfortune here, while sentimental elements
         transform and modify the original plot of the love story decisively. Robert managed
         to show that Lenz challenges even the initial conception of his own text by weaving
         in elements of structural irony and establishing a critical distance between the narrator
         and his hero, heavily drawing on Wieland’s comic epics and thus shifting from a mere
         <span style="font-style:italic">imitatio</span> of traditional poetic patterns to a break with such traditions. Robert interpreted
         this juggling with tradition and innovation as serving Lenz’s »psychological hygiene«
         and providing a »therapy for enthusiasts«.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The following discussion focused on the question whether Robert had analyzed an actual
         case of genre blending or merely a mixture of writing styles – a question pointing
         back to the problem of how genres may constitute themselves from matters of both content
         and form. Robert defended his approach by emphasizing that poetry in fact used to
         define itself <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> based on particular styles of writing. This brought up fundamental issues of modelling
         genre blending: the combination of two genres A and B may result in a hybrid »AB«
         that still reveals its constituents or in a »C« that transforms those constituents
         into a new and potentially monstrous third. However, the problem of how to model poetical
         allusions outside an intertextual paradigm remained unsolved.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Olav Krämer</span> (Freiburg) dedicated his talk to the field of didactic poetry, more specifically
         to »Didactic Odes and Lyric-Didactical Poems: Genre-Mixture in the Theory of Didactic
         Poetry and Its Practice between 1750 and 1850«. Starting from Christoph August Tiedge’s
         <span style="font-style:italic">Urania</span> (1801) Krämer argued that didactic poetry around 1800 underwent a strong lyrification
         which can be related to Schiller’s concept of idealisation. With this hypothesis Krämer
         objected to Hans-Wolf Jäger’s explanation that the »lyrification of didactic poetry«
         (»Lyrisierung der Didaxe«) was based entirely on an increasing subjectivism and sentimentality.
         Krämer discussed how Tiedge in his <span style="font-style:italic">Urania </span>mixes idealism with the traditional philosophical contents of a didactic poem: On
         one hand the poem initially phrases the genre-typical doubts against the existence
         of a benevolent Deity, which are later appeased by the ideas of acting virtuously
         and maintaining the hope of faith. On the other hand the text documents the lyrification
         of didactic poetry by taking up elements of elegies and hymns. But, as Krämer rightfully
         pointed out, these elements were not supposed to mark subjectivity, since the expressed
         sensations and emotions were rather general. An absence of polemic utterances and
         a tendency towards uniform emotions rather reinforces idealization. According to Krämer
         this trend is representative of a general development of didactic poetry in this era:
         Prototypical standards of didactic poetry were reshaped inspired by contemporary trends
         of lyrical poetry. The ensuing discussion expanded on the idea that the development
         of literary genres might gain momentum through the influence of a qualifier which
         turns increasingly dominant.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">
            <!--
                       p. -->Stefan Scherer</span>(Karlsruhe) spoke about the »Gesamtkunstwerk between Drama, Poem and Novel: Experimental
         Genre Hybrids after 1800« and cast a spotlight on extreme examples of genre blending
         in the dramatic writings of Ludwig Tieck and Achim von Arnim: Tieck’s <span style="font-style:italic">Kaiser Octavianus </span>(1804) and Arnim’s <span style="font-style:italic">Ariel's Offenbarungen </span>(1804). Both represent the Romantic paradigm of a »progressive universal poetry« and
         must be located in the outmost threshold region of generic determinability. Scherer
         explained the rising interest in the potential of genre blends after the year 1800
         as a countermovement to Weimar Classicism and its ideal of generic purity: In the
         case of Tieck’s <span style="font-style:italic">Octavianus </span>this resulted in a »Sprachgesamtkunstwerk« combining the most diverse European traditions
         of genres, subject matter and styles; hence the sublime style of <span style="font-style:italic">genus grande </span>is combined with grotesque elements or prose with rhymed verse in different meters.
         Tieck employs effects which cause a musicalization and thus the poetization of all
         textual elements. Scherer therefore characterized <span style="font-style:italic">Octavianus </span>as a »verbal opera«, which implements the poetic program of Romanticism most impressively.
         While the different generic elements are still distinguishable in Tieck’s drama, Arnim’s
         <span style="font-style:italic">Ariel </span>forms a conglomeration of genres in which generic references keep varying in a kaleidoscopic
         way and are mirrored against each other so closely that a definite generic classification
         becomes impossible. While its paratexts mark <span style="font-style:italic">Ariel</span> as a novel, it also contains elements that might be attributed to the epic, tragedy
         or comedy, poetological reflections on the operatic character of the drama and much
         more. Arnim’s text therefore forms a sort of »bricolage«, in which the generic indifference
         is carried to an utmost extreme which to a certain extent could be understood as surrealism
         <span style="font-style:italic">avant la lettre. </span>Scherer’s final conclusion was that the genres taking part in such texts are assigned
         specific functions, even though their combination in such radically boundless texts
         as <span style="font-style:italic">Octavianus </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Ariel</span> makes those texts almost unreadable<span style="font-style:italic">.</span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Stefan Knödler </span>(Tübingen) introduced the audience to another example of extreme genre blending in
         early Romanticism. In his analysis of Wilhelm von Schütz’s drama<span style="font-style:italic">Lacrimas </span>(1803) as a »Dramatic Experiment and Anthology of Romantic Poetry« he demonstrated
         that the destruction of all sorts of generic obligations drove contemporary readers
         to their perceptual limits. However, <span style="font-style:italic">Lacrimas</span> can also be read as an example for the (albeit failed) approach to create new genres
         through an experimental assemblage of traditional generic elements. While early Romantics
         like the brothers Schlegel held Schütz in high esteem, his <span style="font-style:italic">Lacrimas </span>garnered devastating criticism from others, like Kotzebue, who called it a »crazy
         play«. This drama opposes established classicism by integrating disregarded elements
         (especially from medieval literature) into a highly innovative combination of form
         and content. Genre blending occurs particularly in Schütz’s multi-faceted assimilation
         of various lyrical forms: dramatic verse, like iambic or trochaic tetrameter; epic
         verse, often hybrids of ottava and terza rima, and even completely self-contained
         poems. The originality of Schütz’s achievement is most apparent in this latter case,
         e. g. when he fits entire sonnets into the dialogues between his characters. But then
         such passages also illustrate the questionable quality of his innovations, since such
         integrated poems are almost impossible to recognize even for a silent reader. Besides,
         the poetic forms which Schütz uses often are not clearly motivated by the contents
         of the play, which partly results in a mutual damage of plot and form.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Thomas Mohnike </span>(Strasbourg) sketched some possible relations between generic and cultural identity
         in Mikael Niemi’s novel <span style="font-style:italic">Popular Music from Vittula </span>(2000). In his presentation »Genre-sampling and Identity« Mohnike argued that the
         interest of Swedish readers in the culturally and topographically peripheral regions
         of their country depicted in this novel is rooted in an increasing awareness of multiculturalism
         in Sweden. By confronting different writing styles and continuously undermining conventional
         generic expectations, Niemi negotiates questions of identity on the level of narrative
         discourse. His novel is characterized by a boundless 
         <!--
                       p. -->joy of narration and a permanent change of writing styles that is best described as
         an example of narrative <span style="font-style:italic">genre-sampling</span>.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Frieder von Ammon </span>(Munich) added an intermedial approach to the discussion and pleaded for a distinction
         between intra- and intermedial hybrids. His presentation »Mixing and Separating: Friedrich
         Hölderlin and Melodrama« examined Hölderlin’s <span style="font-style:italic">Hero </span>(1788), a poetic monologue based on the Ovidian tale of Hero and Leander. Von Ammon
         argued that this lyric-dramatic poem reveals the tense emotionality of Hero’s extreme
         situation in the form of a melodrama without music. While explicit stage directions
         mark the melodramatic character of the text, it differs from the established generic
         prototype of the melodrama by using verse instead of prose – this musicalization of
         poetic language replaces an actual musical accompaniment and can be interpreted as
         Hölderlin’s statement in the contemporary debate on the legitimacy of decidedly intermedial
         genres. <span style="font-style:italic">Hero </span>takes this debate one step further by blending the intermedial melodrama with lyrical
         poetry: music turns into the purely verbal music of poetic verse here. From this point
         of view Hölderlin’s genre blending can well be characterised as a focal point of his
         poetics.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Monika Schmitz-Emans</span> (Bochum) examined »Catalogue Texts in Novels« and thus discussed an entirely different
         case of genre blending, which involves both fictional and factual elements and creates
         an underlying tension between visualization, representation and absence. She approached
         these problems from a narratological and aesthetic angle: While narrative fiction
         aims at achieving an illusion of sensual presence of their textual universes, typical
         catalogue texts emphasize the physical absence of the objects they represent by merely
         naming them. Since they invoke familiar objects, they appear highly authentic and
         reliable, yet simultaneously highlight the elusive character of the listed items.
         The novels that Schmitz-Emans analyzed take advantage of these characteristic ambiguities
         of catalogue texts: Max Aub uses a catalogue of pictures to represent the stations
         of a fictitious painter’s fragmentary biography in his novel <span style="font-style:italic">Josep Torres Campalans</span>, while George Perecs <span style="font-style:italic;color:1C1C1C">Un Cabinet d’amateur</span> employs a painting showing an art collection to expose how represented objects may
         elude their beholders. A third option can be observed in Alessandro Baricco’s <span style="font-style:italic">Oceano Mare: </span>Here an artist’s attempt at representing water by means of water illustrates the limits
         of representation and the transitions between being and non-being. In all these novels
         catalogue texts are used to reflect on transience and the passage of time, on disappearance
         and on the fundamental artistic desire to generate presence.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Moritz Baßler</span> (Münster) concerned himself with the »Genesis of Genres in Pop Culture« and its social
         respectively cultural and historical contexts. He compared the emergence of genres
         in pop culture to the generation of labels under commercial market conditions. Baßler
         assumed that already since the 18<sup>th</sup> century, but even more so since the rise of modernism genre references in high culture
         are merely playful recollections. This differs considerably from their decisive function
         in popular culture in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, where the success of artistic products depends on their sales figures. Here
         paratextually marked genres serve as reliable labels that promise to satisfy the expectations
         of customers who are to spend money on the corresponding products. The according market
         mechanism is characterized by a shift from diachronic to synchronic reception, meaning
         that successful products are immediately demanded and consumed in high numbers and
         therefore commissioned and produced in serial forms. Under such market conditions
         producers and consumers alike contribute to stabilizing genres by balancing supply
         and demand. Nonetheless generic innovations remain possible, even though every product
         is required to correspond to existing expectations. Products can for example combine
         familiar generic patterns with unexpected elements thus gradually shift or expand
         the generic horizon.

                       p. -->Marion Gymnich</span>(Bonn) spoke about »Genre Hybridity in the 21<sup>st</sup>-Century British Novel: Consolidation or Dynamization of the Genre Spectrum?« She
         suggested a scalable model that could support systematic and nuanced distinctions
         between different degrees of generic blending. Contemporary British novels offer rich
         material for developing such a model, because they show a clear tendency towards mixing
         different narrative genres. Gymnich emphasized that this tendency is based on a distinct
         awareness of genres, which is documented by a current revival of strictly genre-oriented
         writing styles. At one end of the scale are forms that merge genre attributes and
         completely blur the lines between them, while the other extreme would be texts in
         which distinct generic elements remain clearly recognizable, which e. g. allows a
         text to change from one genre to another between different paragraphs. In the case
         of David Mitchell’s <span style="font-style:italic">Cloud Atlas</span> (2004) for example the reader is challenged to synthesize a complex arrangement of
         time levels, settings and genres into an overriding unity, which requires a higher
         level of activity than novels which amalgamate their generic elements.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Klaus Birnstiel </span>(Basel) concluded the conference program with thoughts about »Genre Blending in Rainald
         Goetz’s Contemporary Writing Styles or Postmodernism as Early Romanticism«<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>Birnstiel argued that novels in general and the postmodern novel in particular can
         absorb a wide range of literary styles without changing their generic identity. To
         grasp the conditions of this blending process adequately, Birnstiel first characterized
         genres as accumulations of a specific knowledge on the side of the readers, and as
         expectations derived from that knowledge. Building on this model, genres can be described
         as mutually confining systems available to the author. For a closer analysis of the
         strategies and effects associated with this communication process Birnstiel chose
         selected writings by Rainald Goetz, who since the 1980s permanently keeps integrating
         new stylistic and medial elements into his texts (images, sounds, videos, and online
         content), but without ever leaving the territory of the novel. Since the novel can
         only be characterized as <span style="font-style:italic">the </span>hybrid genre <span style="font-style:italic">par excellence, </span>it would be rather misleading to analyze it in terms of genre blending: Its hybrid
         nature is fundamental to the core concept of the novel itself. Finally Birnstiel pondered
         about possible parallels between Goetz’s aesthetic principles and some characteristic
         tendencies of Early Romanticism: Both show a particular affirmative pathos, tend to
         merge of different writing styles and genres, and are subject to intense self-reflection.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">A highly fruitful final plenary discussion summarized the difficulties of finding
         a viable notion of genre and genre blending: The question if it was possible to constitute
         distinct genre profiles based on cognitive models remained just as controversial as
         the problem how to establish a diachronic profile of genre attributes and poetics.
         As the conference had demonstrated convincingly, heterogeneous combinations, blends
         and hybrids are the standard case rather than exceptions in literary history and therefore
         deserve nuanced, systematic and transparent methods of analysis. The conviction that
         such a profound analytical examination of historical documents must not relinquish
         a close reading of the texts and has to maintain an alert awareness of their historicity
         and historical functions remained beyond all dispute.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Titel_Rezension">Form. Perspectives on a Literary Theory</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch" lang="de" translate="no">Form. Perspektiven einer literaturwissenschaftlichen Theorie. Universität zu Köln,
         28./29.03.2019
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The Conference »Form. Perspektiven einer literaturwissenschaftlichen Theorie« took
         place at the University of Cologne, 28th and 29th of March and was hosted by Prof.
         Torsten Hahn and Prof. Nico Pethes (University of Cologne). Following recent publications
         that emphasized the social and political meaning of aesthetic forms, e.g. by Caroline
         Levine and Dirk Baecker, the conference asked for the revenue of theoretical notions
         of form for literary studies after the philosophical debates around the distinction
         of form and ›Gehalt‹ in the 19th and 20th century. The main focus was the question
         how system theory’s abstract distinctions redundancy/variety and form/medium, as well
         as the notion of an ›inner ornament‹ can be applied to the analysis of specific literary
         texts, addressing both their semantic and aesthetic procedures as well as their material
         shape. The latter meaning of ›form‹ as the actual surface of a given text links literary
         form theory with notions of design; the first refers to current explorations of actor-network
         theory and the performative aspect of writing. The assumption is that form as a concept
         is not only relevant for the aesthetic debates in the 19th century but should be a
         vital part of analyzing contemporary literature and other art phenomena, such as pop
         literature. Form, and its dynamization within an ornament, is indissolubly linked
         both to the material and social environment of literary production and to the internal
         self-reflection of literature and thus to its intrinsic value. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The conference was divided into three sections, concerning different aspects and scopes
         of form theory: Theory and Media of Form, Aesthetics of Form and Literary History,
         and Cultural Artefacts and Forms of Surface. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">1. Theory and Media of Form </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the first section, three speakers addressed the basic question of how the concept
         of form can be productively used in current literary studies. The different speakers
         presented very different approaches, thus opening a large spectrum for possible answers,
         reaching from abandoning the concept of form due to its potentially judgmental function
         to using form as a means of paying attention to new and innovative contexts, e.g.
         contrasting different material environments for literary or cultural environments
         for theoretical production.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In his speech »Form Inhalt Kanon« (Form Content Canon), Thomas Hecken (Siegen) presented
         the challenging assumption that the concept of form in literary debates is only motivated
         by the aim to exclude certain texts or certain statements about texts from the literary
         canon. The invitation to talk about the ›form‹ of certain literary texts serves to
         create a boundary between superficial and profound statements on texts. The process
         of canonizing is also organized along these lines, as ›good‹ texts tend to be those
         who invite profound statements by being inaccessible. Hecken also doubted that architectural
         or pictorial vocabulary that tends to be used when describing the formal qualities
         of literature can simply be attributed to literary texts. He suggested that instead
         of using the concept of ›form‹ as proof for the ›value‹ of a certain text, scholars
         should rather identify specific forms within texts and conversations about texts,
         without generalizing them under the abstract term ›form‹.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->This provocative approach on the subject of form stimulated an intensive debate on
         the value of ›form‹ for literary analysis. It was argued that the distinction form/media
         can be used to compare literary artefacts and practices with other cultural phenomena.
         Concerning popular texts, the notion of form could be used to develop a different
         approach on the ›complexity‹ of a certain text, e.g. by including the specific context.
         This was then linked to the notion of form in early romanticism, where form is not
         thought of as stable and static but rather as dynamic and infinite.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Matthias Bickenbach (Köln) with his talk »Die Form des Buchs« (The Form of the Book)
         addressed the material surface of literature, more specifically the printed book as
         opposed to digital forms of reading. He presented the book as a two-sided-form, relating
         to Niklas Luhmann’s concept of form and its transfer to book sciences by Georg Stanitzek.
         The printed book, according to Bickenbach, is the center of many scriptural practices
         like taking notes and underlining, the actual ›studium‹, browsing and randomly opening
         pages. The book is thus linked to our theoretical conception of language and our practices
         of doing science – this can be exemplified by Saussure’s example of the tree, which
         is used to explain the double nature of a written sign and also refers back to the
         material quality of a book.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The discussion centered around the question of how the material format of literature
         and its form are interconnected. There were some open questions on how digital formats
         change the notion of literature, e.g. concerning the distinction of text and context,
         e.g. when comments are integrated into the actual text as it is technically possible
         with e-books.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Elena Beregow (Hamburg) presented a talk on »Die Oberflächen der Theorie. Von heißen
         und kalten Medien der Theoriebildung« (The Surfaces of Theory. About hot and cold
         Media of Theorizing). She referred to Levine’s concept of form as an arrangement of
         elements to describe theories as social, political and aesthetic forms that always
         take place within and themselves create an atmosphere which can e.g. be described
         as either hot (Deleuze) or cold (Luhmann). Beregow proposed ›atmosphere‹ as a concept
         to describe this appeal and its sources, as it forms a link between form and medium,
         both actively shaping and simply passively surrounding its objects. She distinguished
         three dimensions of atmosphere: the text itself, its formulations and ›sound‹, the
         reception as interesting or irritating and the material and social spaces of theory,
         e.g. reading groups. Thus, the concept of atmosphere links the aesthetic appearance
         of theory with political and social contexts.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Beregow’s introduction of the concept of atmosphere into form theory provoked a discussion
         about it being a concept between form and medium that might serve to elucidate the
         process of transforming one into the other. The discussion also focused the potential
         of viewing theory as a genre, which is also defined by aesthetic procedures and thus
         by formal aspects. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">2. Aesthetics of Form and Literary History</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The second section presented explicit reflections on form in the history of philosophy
         and literature. The scope ranged from the 18th century with Baumgarten’s aesthetics
         as well as early romanticism on to the 19th century with Stifter to the 20th century
         and poems by Francis Ponge and Ilse Aichinger. The talks presented both reconstructions
         of a specific notion of form within the aesthetic discourse, e.g. early romanticism
         or socialist art, as well as formal interpretations of specific literary texts. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->Patrick Hohlweck (Köln) with his talk on the »Frühgeschichte der Form (Baumgarten)«
         (The Early History of Form) presented a reconstruction of a notion of form in Baumgarten’s
         <span style="font-style:italic">Aesthetica</span> that navigates between a rhetorical concept of adequacy between sign and content
         and the possibility of expressing a multitude of meanings in one term and a sculptural
         concept of form as the shaping of a figure out of raw material by skimming it according
         to necessity. Baumgarten’s attempt to combine these incompatible aspects results in
         an innovative approach towards form that can be related to and probably distinguished
         from both the modern concepts of system and of an autonomous artwork. Hohlweck identified
         three aspects of this new concept of form as selectivity, (spatial) simultaneity and
         (temporal) perfectibility.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The discussion focused the question of complexity and its relationship to the concept
         of form. For Baumgarten, the most beautiful form seems to be the sensually fullest
         – a monstrosity of form is not conceivable for him. Form thus has a quantitative index
         as a reservoir for as much potentiality as possible.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Anja Lemke (Köln) with »Philosophische Arabeske« (Philosophical Arabesque) read F.
         Schlegel’s philosophical and literary work as an exploration into the possibilities
         of a formal observation of texts. She read the romantic ›arabesque‹ as the expression
         of both subjective self-reflection and the reflection of the work of art. The arabesque
         thus is a dynamic way of processing aporias that result of the universality of observing.
         Lemke presented both the so-called ›recension‹ of Goethe’s novel <span style="font-style:italic">Wilhelm Meister</span> as well as Schlegel’s lectures <span style="font-style:italic">Transcendentalphilosophie</span> as two examples of the intertwining of self-reflection (›Bildung‹) and formal (even
         mathematical) reflection of other philosophical and literary texts under the banner
         of the arabesque. Lemke thus argued that the early romanticism’s concept of form includes
         a perception of formlessness, both in the literary and philosophical field. Thus,
         early romanticism anticipates the distinction form/medium.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The discussion centered on the theory of the novel as the modern genre between chaos
         and form as well as on Schlegel’s concept of form and the arabesque and how both of
         these notions are related to the idea of infinity. Here, Hegel’s famous critique of
         a ›bad‹ infinity came up again, which Lemke opposed by insinuating on the dynamic
         and performative character of early romanticism’s concepts of form and the arabesque.
         
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Peter Neumann (Jena) presented his thoughts on »Entzeitlichung. Zur Temporalität der
         reinen ästhetischen Form« (Detemporalization. On the Temporality of Pure Aesthetic
         Form). Neumann detected an ambivalent attitude towards the temporality of form in
         early romanticism. On the one hand, the notion of form evokes temporality, as form
         always refers to the passing of time, on the other hand it defines something as stable
         and ideal and transcends the individual towards the absolute. Thus, Neumann characterizes
         the aesthetics of pure form as shaped by a double experience of ›Verzeitlichung‹ (temporalization)
         and ›Entzeitlichung‹ (de-temporalization). Neumann criticizes idealism’s conception
         of form as basically de-temporalized and blind towards absolutely formless, chaotic
         states insofar as they are always trying to reintegrate them into formal relations.
         
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The discussion posed several challenges of Neumann’s depicturing of early romanticism.
         Especially Hölderlin and Schlegel were pointed out as examples for conceptualizations
         of ruptures and dynamization. A remaining question was if early romanticism’s concept
         of ›chaos‹ is really formless, or if it is just conceptualized in order to become
         form itself.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Nico Pethes (Köln) talked about »Aspekte ornamentaler Prosa bei Stifter« (Aspects
         of Ornamental Prose in Stifter). He argued that even realistic literature can be viewed
         as basically figurative and concerned with the arrangement of material. Form, here,
         is understood with the 
         <!--
                       p. -->Russian formalist Sklovskij as aesthetic procedure. As proof, he presented a reading
         of Stifter’s novel <span style="font-style:italic">Witiko</span>. Several scenes within this novel present an astonishing amount of redundancy that
         reveal structural orders, both in a social and poetic sense. Instead of viewing these
         scenes as ›boring‹ or ›non-artistic‹, Pethes reads them as self-referentially posing
         questions of ordering and shaping both textual and social worlds. Thematic depletion
         thus leads to the visualization of formal patterns – a process that Pethes somewhat
         ironically calls ›pure prose‹.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the discussion, the notion of procedure was stressed as a vital aspect of form,
         linking poetic and social practices. The distinction redundancy/variety was considered
         as prolific for different ways of analyzing texts and social structures, especially
         with a historical point of view. The notion of ›pure prose‹ was re-described as an
         oxymoron and thus only a threshold for aesthetic descriptions.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Armin Schäfer (Bochum) with »Prosagedicht und lyrische Prosa« (Prose Poetry and Lyrical
         Prose) proposed a form-oriented close reading of several poems by Ilse Aichinger and
         Francis Ponge as an innovative approach towards genre-definitions in the interstice
         between prose and poetry. Schäfer’s model concentrates on how the generation of form
         is firmly tied to the (im)possibility of observing and its reflection within the text.
         Schäfer distinguished two genres: on the one hand the prose poem that links form to
         a grammatical – not personal – subject, a distinct and singular position for observation.
         On the other hand, he described lyrical prose that bears an autobiographical function,
         insofar as it generates form by means of negation and remembrance, two kinds of feedback
         circles. Subjectivity here becomes an effect that can be observed as well as other
         effects of form.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The discussion centered first on the relation between form and complexity. Complexity
         has to be reduced to become form but complexity also has to be found in the environment
         and reintroduced into the text. Another aspect was the relation between form, text
         and the speaking subject, that can be observed both as the powerful generator of form
         and as being subjected by the formal structure of language.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Jürgen Brokoff (Berlin) talked on »Literarische Form und Intervention« (Literary Form
         and Intervention). He critically analyzed the use of the term ›form‹ and its combination
         with the idea of ›work‹ in the aesthetic discourse of the 19th and 20th century. Brokoff
         pointed out that the question of form is always linked to the question of autonomy
         and heteronomy, as well as to the question of the (im)possibility of political art.
         He showed that the critique of form in the 1830s and 1930s levelled against the concept
         of work. Referring to Walter Benjamin’s <span style="font-style:italic">Der Autor als Produzent</span>, Brokoff presented a concept of form that is not tied to the idea of an ideal and
         enclosed artwork and can thus be linked to more ›democratic‹ ideas of art and even
         to the idea of art as political and social intervention.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The discussion again emphasized the question of how a perspective on form can stress
         the political aspect of literature rather than separating it from society. The possibility
         of participation and democracy could then be viewed as a matter of form and aesthetic
         procedure. Another aspect was the connection of form and material media environments
         as being central to the social and also political function of art and art forms.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">3. Cultural Artefacts and Forms of Surface</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The third and last section presented three different approaches towards the question
         of how form and material are connected and how one can theoretically conceive of this
         connection. One term that is widely used in this context is the notion of ›surface‹,
         which was critically 
         <!--
                       p. -->explored by the speakers. The cultural artefacts ranged from musical pieces over sculptures
         and shelves to, again, literary texts and their version of surface.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Torsten Hahn (Köln) spoke about »Pop und/als Oberfläche« (Pop and/as Surface). He
         proposed a concretization of the term ›form‹ by the concepts of reflection and ornament
         as the art work’s own asymmetrization between art and non-art. Hahn presented a definition
         of pop as the decontextualization of popular things where their pure surface creates
         the depth for ornamental self-reflection. In contrast to pop art, pop literature first
         has to transfer the materiality into signs. Hahn analyzed this transition from popular
         commodities into book covers and finally into text with the example of <a id="_DdeLink__336_225470435">
            <!--anchor--></a>Rafael Horzon’s <span style="font-style:italic">Das weiße Buch</span>. For pop literature, the book as a material object can be identified as the turning
         point between the form as material surface and the form of a written text.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The discussion centered around the specificity of literature in the pop ensemble,
         e.g. addressing the distinction between a novel and a simulation of a novel for Horzon’s
         <span style="font-style:italic">Das weiße Buch</span>, and on the necessity of a new concept of literature in order to comprise the analyzed
         chains of translations. The relation between ornament and reflection was again stressed
         as vital for any formal analysis.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Bettina Schlüter (Bonn) gave a talk on »Musikalische Form – Ästhetische Regulative
         der Beobachtung« (Musical Form – Aesthetic Regulations of Observation). She explored
         the possibility of a temporal formal analysis of music drawing back on the writings
         of Ernst Curt in 1912. With Curt, she proposed a notion of musical form that is opposed
         to traditional musical morphology as it regards form as a relational opposite to sheer
         capacity. Form thus refers to the fight of managing the ungraspable movements of time
         and space, the constitutive tension between forming and form. With the example of
         the well-known Tristan chord, Schlüter shows how Curt’s attempts of parametrizing
         different sensual effects of music can grasp the transition between musical and kinetic
         energy – music psychology here becomes the foundational research for questions of
         musical form.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The discussion stressed the urge of Curt’s and other’s formal analysis to grasp also
         the media environment of conventional concepts of form. This specific version of formal
         analysis was considered as originating in the late 18th and early 19th century, in
         early romanticism. Another aspect of discussion was the relationship between music
         and literature and other art forms and the question, if and how formal analysis can
         be a theory of art in general.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Heinz Drügh (Frankfurt) spoke about »<span style="font-style:italic">Pulchritudo vaga</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">pulchritudo adhaerens</span>. Überlegungen zum Begriff der Form zwischen Autonomie und Ware.« (Thoughts on the
         Notion of Form between Autonomy and Commodity). With the example of Ottessa Moshfeg’s
         novel <span style="font-style:italic">My Year of Rest and Relaxation</span>, that presents itself as earmarked insofar as it was followed by a guidebook on how
         to write successful novels, he explored the possibility of an aesthetic re-entry of
         goal-bound forms as <span style="font-style:italic">pulchitudo adhaerens</span>, in contrast to the idea of an autonomous work of art always connected with the notion
         of form. This heteronomous concept of form can be described with Levine’s notion of
         affordance, encompassing both the material and social realm and thus blurring the
         strictly separated spheres of <span style="font-style:italic">pulchritudo vaga</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">adhaerens</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The discussion centered around Kant’s distinction between <span style="font-style:italic">pulchritudo vaga</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">pulchritudo adhaerens</span> that remained a constant point of reference throughout the conference and proposed
         it to be a dialectical opposition.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->The conference first of all showed that it is neither possible nor desirable to determine
         a certain concept of form as an operational definition for literary or aesthetic studies
         in general. The notion of form rather defines a nodal point, where different aesthetic,
         poetic and theoretical gestures can be identified, traced and compared. Two different
         approaches to the term ›form‹ however can be distinguished as having shaped all the
         contributions and discussions. On the one hand, form is conceived as the outer shape
         of some inner content or material, thus enclosing and defining an autonomous, perfect
         sphere. On the other hand, form is conceived as being itself the dynamic opposition
         between the static and the dynamic, thus encompassing both the form itself and the
         process of form generation. The impossibility of choosing one of these options as
         the right requires supplementary terms and ideas in order to analyze distinct aesthetic
         objects and texts according to their form. The different contributions and discussions
         proposed various terms that can help to concretize what is meant by form in any given
         case. On the one hand, there are oppositions and/or related concepts like atmosphere,
         medium, surface, material, that can serve to clarify what is meant by form. On the
         other hand, the notion of form can be processed along dynamic concepts like the ornament,
         the arabesque, reflection and procedure. Every formal analysis of specific artworks
         must further define its concept of form by drawing on these additional terms, and
         also situate its specific concept of form within the conceptual history. The turning
         point of form’s conceptual history, as the conference has confirmed again, can be
         located around 1800, in early romanticism. Beside the restraints and challenges that
         are posed by the term ›form‹, the conference has shown how, by providing an overarching
         perspective that always has to be concretized, the term can provoke innovative approaches
         to specific texts, e.g. including their material, social and political environment,
         as well as to literary studies’ basic concepts, like genre or epoch. Thus, it is not
         advisable to regard formal analysis only as a historical way of dealing with literature
         and art. Instead, the possibilities and challenges of formal analysis should and can
         be explored in every approach to a literary text.

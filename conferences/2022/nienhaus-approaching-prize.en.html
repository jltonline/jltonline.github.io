      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The symposium <span style="font-style:italic">Literature in the Nobel Era. Comparative, theoretical, and archival approaches to
            the Nobel Prize in Literature</span> took place at the <span style="font-style:italic">German Literature Archive</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps"> (DLA)</span> in Marbach and online from August 25<sup>th</sup> through 27<sup>th</sup> 2021. It was organised both transdisciplinary as well as transnational by literary
         scholars <span style="font-weight:bold">Jørgen Sneis</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Carlos Spoerhase</span> (Bielefeld) and sociologist <span style="font-weight:bold">Jacob Habinek</span> (Linköping) in cooperation with <span style="font-weight:bold">Sandra Richter</span> (DLA) as well as <span style="font-weight:bold">Mats Malm</span> (Swedish Academy<span style="font-weight:bold">)</span> and aimed to establish a dialogue between different approaches in contemporary research
         on the Nobel Prize in Literature.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The introduction by <span style="font-weight:bold">Carlos Spoerhase</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Jørgen Sneis</span> began with a reference to Tim Park’s critical questioning of the Nobel Prize and
         Pascal Casanova’s mapped world literary space. The question of comparability, they
         argued, is the heuristically valuable starting point for understanding literary prizes
         and their presuppositional history. They went on to recall Alfred Nobel’s last will
         and his wish that nationality should not be the dominant criterion for deciding who
         receives an award. Only the ›worthiest person‹ should be nominated. Despite this rejection
         of nationality as a criterion, the Nobel Prize shows a reciprocal dynamic between
         nationalism and internationalism. Spoerhase and Sneis also drew attention to the practice
         of compiling tables on the winners of the Prize. This quantitative practice represents
         an effort to link literary success to nationality. At the same time, this method of
         quantification opens up a distanced horizon of comparison. The constellation could,
         they suggested, be described with Francesca Orsini’s analytical term ›thin knowledge‹.
         In need of clarification, they argued, are the canonisation, reading practice, translation
         practice, attention economy, globalisation tendencies and politics associated with
         the Nobel Prize. According to Spoerhase and Sneis, this task can only be accomplished
         by an interdisciplinary research community.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In literary prize culture, the fabrication of excellence and prestige is a collective
         effort by heterogeneous stakeholders, demanding a broad approach for a full understanding
         of the complex transactions and interplays that produce the specific notion of ›value‹
         inherent to literary prizes. The Nobel Prize as the most prominent literary prize,
         awarded annually (with a few exceptions) by the Swedish Academy since 1901, is certainly
         no exception. The convenors, including the Swedish Academy and the DLA, took this
         into account not only by inviting scholars from a wide range of disciplines but also
         by including the voices of some of these stakeholders, such as a Nobel laureate, a
         publisher, archivists and academy members. Fittingly, the opening statements by two
         of the co-conveners addressed this institutional entanglement both in words and <span style="font-style:italic">qua persona</span>. Mats Malm, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, characterised the symposium’s
         subject matter, the Nobel Prize, as a »celebration of literature and a constant stimulant
         to discussion«, while Sandra Richter, head of the DLA, commented on the Swedish Academy’s
         co-convenorship of the symposium as »an act of self-reflection with external assistance«.
         According to Richter, the archive-based research results – which also played a role
         during the 
         <!--
                       p. -->conference – clearly showed how productive the connection between practice and theory
         is. Significantly, the conference brought to light the very attention implicitly given
         to the Nobel Prize in Literature. The current task is to examine the various Nobel
         effects. Richter emphasised that informative sources are archived in the DLA Marbach.
         Fact is: there is still a lot to discover. As Richter and Malm are both representatives
         of literary institutions as well as literary scholars, their remarks appeared programmatic
         for what is at stake when institutional frameworks of literature both undergo and
         contribute to scholarly analysis. It seems that this »external assistance« can be
         understood in both directions: scholarly research activity could use some outer input
         from practitioners to reflect on their methods and practices, and the practitioners
         should have something to gain from scholarship in order to design tools for – an updated
         – self-reflection.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the first keynote lecture <span style="font-weight:bold">Gisèle Sapiro</span> (Paris) emphasised at the outset that Pierre Bourdieu’s repertoire of methods is
         particularly suitable for examining literary prizes such as the Nobel Prize and for
         understanding them. In this way, the symbolic economy as well as the processes of
         the genesis of world literature can be recognised. Like Spoerhase and Sneis, she referred
         to the practice of scaling in this context. It needs to be clarified which stakeholders
         have the necessary agency, which unofficial criteria exist and where the limit of
         price autonomy is to be located. For the French publishing landscape, the establishment
         of a new canon could be observed. This is bound to the publishing houses that have
         a monopoly position and a high symbolic capital. Overall, Sapiro explained, French,
         English and German publishing houses dominate the international literary prize landscape.
         The chance of international recognition and translation rises and falls with the respective
         publishing house. Ultimately, the publisher’s affiliation determines the chances of
         winning the prize. Deviation tendencies in the awarding of prizes are mostly motivated
         by political events. While the Nobel Prize has already started to take diversity into
         account, it also reinforces modes of domination. Sapiro emphasised that it is not
         the task of the Nobel Prize to change these asymmetrical power constellations. Yet,
         this does not exempt it from the need to promote diversity in the long term.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In his talk, <span style="font-weight:bold">Fabien Accominotti</span> (Madison) analysed mechanisms that generate a dominant status in the field of literature.
         It is striking, Accominotti stated, that women rarely win literary prizes. At the
         same time, the Nobel Prize narrows the view of the literary field. From an award perspective,
         there is only the chosen one and the rest. Furthermore, there is no explicit definition
         of greatness, and hierarchy is based on the rules of performance. <span style="font-weight:bold">Vaughn Schmutz</span> (Charlotte) also explored the relationship between winners and losers. A significant
         balance of power in favour of the Western countries can be outlined. This is, as Schmutz
         claimed, serially perpetuated by the Swedish Academy. With the help of current text-mining
         methods, a typology of winners could be determined. Media coverage provides a rich
         source for this project: it also shows how the work and particularly the author as
         prize-winner are evaluated. According to <span style="font-weight:bold">Jacob Habinek</span> (Linköping), the Nobel Prize procedure could be considered as the archetype of the
         literature prize, and it already reinforced an existing academic power. Habinek gave
         a structured insight into his current research project in which he is evaluating the
         digitised archive holdings of the Swedish Academy. The initial results confirm the
         finding that a predominant Western position of power is clearly evident. However,
         the Nordic countries used to have the position of an outsider. Sweden – this may hardly
         come as a surprise – was later overrepresented. It can also be stated: the most nominated
         countries have also received the most awards. In contrast: the most nominated authors
         did not receive the most awards.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->During the first evening’s artist talk between Nobel laureate <span style="font-weight:bold">Herta Müller</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Jan Bürger</span> (Marbach), Müller’s perspective on the relevance of the prize was added to those
         of academic observers and of the awarding institution. Even though Müller ascribed
         the prize an aura that you have to relate to, if you are suited for it or not, she
         also emphatically deflated the impact that it had on her own life. In relation to
         the smaller prizes that she had received early in her career, the Nobel Prize was
         almost negligible. These first prizes assured her physical protection, as the ruling
         regime could not harm a writer who had received that sort of attention abroad. While
         almost unchallenged in structural prize hierarchies, the Nobel apparently can be rendered
         – on a personal level – close to insignificance.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In a sense, the first panel of day two found a way to scholarly integrate the first
         day’s initial impulses given by the ›external‹ figures of the archivist, the academy
         member, and the author. <span style="font-weight:bold">Alexander Bareis</span> (Lund) placed emphasis on the »unique position inside the Academy«, from which Kjell
         Espmark had written extensively on the criteria for the Nobel Prize. He also raised
         the question from what other sources »from the outside« one could generate knowledge
         of these criteria. How can we tell to what extent moral judgements influence the prize
         decisions? By analysing public statements from members of the Academy on the heated
         debate surrounding the prize awarded to Peter Handke in 2018, Bareis presented a spectrum
         of different modes of artistic autonomy that were implicit in these utterances. This
         ranged from a rigid distinction between the author’s political positions and the aesthetic
         value of their work all the way to a strong link, where an author’s work is directly
         contaminated by his/her positioning. <span style="font-weight:bold">Rebecca Braun</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps">(</span>Lancaster) caught up on the Herta Müller reading from the previous evening, where
         an older newspaper article on an earlier presentation by Müller was read, much to
         the amusement of both audience and performers. The detailed depiction of Müller’s
         gestures and the invoked seriousness of her appearance in that article stood in stark
         contrast to the joyful laughter it provoked on stage. Braun addressed this relation
         between how we perceive the consecrated author and how the article construed an image
         of what a Nobel laureate »should look like«. The Nobel Prize therefore requires raising
         questions on different modes of authorship – from celebratory to utopian – that go
         along with the attention politics of award winners. The example of Nobel laureates
         shows that authorship too is co-created by a variety of stakeholders, thus a constant
         change is inherent to the »image of how to be a human who writes«. The archive as
         one instance of this co-creation was discussed in <span style="font-weight:bold">Tim Sommer’s</span> (Edinburgh) paper. Based on the observation that authors meanwhile tend to prepare
         the archival future of their papers and documents while still alive, Sommer addressed
         questions of value around these transactions in relation to the authors’ prize careers
         with special attention to Nobel laureates. As Sommer showed that some laureates’ collections
         are sold to archives for amounts even exceeding the Nobel Prize money, he delivered
         a striking example of the complex structure of the interplay between symbolic and
         economic capital in the literary field – here approaching the art trade. These transactions
         show, he argued, how prestigious prizes such as the Nobel raise the stakes of consecration
         on both sides of the transaction, thereby pointing towards questions on causality
         and contiguity in the circulation of both symbolic and economic value between author,
         prizes and archives.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The second panel of day two paid special attention to inter-prize relations. <span style="font-weight:bold">Nils Hansson</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Daniela Link</span> (Düsseldorf) asked what role medicine, itself a field in which the Nobel Prize is
         awarded, plays in the nominations of »physician authors« for the literary prize in
         order to perform excellence and prestige. They outlined a case study on Georg Bonne,
         hardly known today, and his »cross-boundary campaign« for the Nobel Prize. The 
         <!--
                       p. -->nominations, arguably written by a ghostwriter, emphasised Bonne’s image as a »doctor
         of the poor« in order to meet the presumably humanitarian and idealistic standards
         which the nominators expected from the prize committee. <span style="font-weight:bold">Stevie Marsden</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">’</span>s (Leicester) paper focused on inter-prize relations not through the scope of differentiation
         <span style="font-style:italic">qua </span>discipline, but rather with an interest in the hierarchical order between prizes,
         vaguely resembling the hierarchy scale between high and low culture. The »single winner
         axiom« which characterises the logic of most cultural prizes, according to Marsden,
         seems to apply equivalently to the very field of cultural prizes itself: academic
         attention is drawn to the few prizes with the most impact and thereby generates a
         blindside towards prize culture at large. An attempt to fill this gap was provided
         by <span style="font-weight:bold">John Raimo</span> (New York), who concluded the panel with insights on two »anti-Nobels«, the Prix
         international du éditeurs and the Prix Formentor. His historical reconstruction of
         the emergence of these prizes in the 1960s showed how the European publishing industry
         attempted to use these prizes to secure publishing rights and to undermine the impact
         of the Nobel Prize.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Another panel addressed the time span <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> being awarded the prize and was opened by a detailed case study by <span style="font-weight:bold">Stefanie Leuenberger</span> (Zürich). Leuenberger presented archival findings on Carl Spitteler’s authorship,
         such as documented cooperations and correspondences, which led up to the Nobel Prize
         of 1919. A more wide angled approach to pre-Nobel careers was presented by <span style="font-weight:bold">Urs Büttner</span> (Düsseldorf), who traced back the circulation of translations of awarded works through
         data sets collected between 1944 and 1970. The results show that the peak of most
         of the laureates’ translations occurred long before the actual Prize was awarded and
         that two patterns can be distinguished: »hype authors« with a steep translation curve
         and »lifetime achievement authors« with a relatively flat curve. <span style="font-weight:bold">Jana Rüegg’s</span> (Uppsala) analysis of the Swedish publishing landscape confirmed the finding that
         translations reach the highest publication numbers before and not after the Nobel
         Prize, even though the awarded work is often »reintroduced to the market« after the
         Prize. Her results also showed that dramatic and poetic works by Nobel laureates are
         far less published than novels.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">James English</span> (Philadelphia), author of arguably the most cited book of the symposium (<span style="font-style:italic">The Economy of Prestige</span>, 2005), opened his keynote lecture with a rejection of »the bad habit to strictly
         distinguish economic and symbolic capital« and an emphatic plea for the conceptual
         »impurity of prestige«. Challenging his own signature thesis that scandals do not
         form a threat to, but rather constitute, the very life blood of prize culture, he
         presented a surprising revision of his earlier prognosis that the recent #metoo scandals
         linked to the Swedish Academy would not undermine but possibly even inflate the significance
         of the Nobel. Instead, English now proposed that the inability of the Swedish Academy
         to gain from the momentum and rearrange its anachronistic structure may have created
         an opening for a new player to enter the stage in order to meet the demands posed
         to a global literary prize: a player equipped with even more economic power, necessary
         to create a »wow effect« like the one the Nobel had in 1901, and with a more contemporary
         take on recent debates on identity politics and diversification of laureates, necessary
         to claim the moral high ground that the Nobel’s philanthropic roots had once installed.
         This player, his speculative suggestion goes, could be MacKenzie Scott. The way the
         circulation of cultural prestige is structured, English argued, the demand for a »prize
         of prizes« will remain intact, yet the monopoly the Nobel had on this position for
         a long time may be lost.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Day three started out with <span style="font-weight:bold">Michael Ka-chi Cheuk’s</span> (Hong Kong) proposal to use the term ›censorship‹ in a broad sense, including not
         only forceful and direct interventions 
         <!--
                       p. -->but also the soft powers which restrict an author’s voice as a result of the implicit
         demand for a Nobel laureate to »represent certain values«. Cheuk exemplified the matter
         in a case study on the Olympic gathering in Atlanta 1996, where Nobel laureates were
         united and publicly presented in a series of panel discussions during the Olympic
         Games. As the idealised roots of both the Nobel Prize and the modern Olympic Games
         were and remain discursively intertwined with the internationalist peace movement
         at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, Cheuk argued that a staging of this kind yields implications on how the
         laureates are »structurally censored« in their function <span style="font-style:italic">as</span> laureates. This kind of instrumentalisation of laureates as representatives of a
         larger community was also addressed in <span style="font-weight:bold">Takashi Inoue’s</span> (Kyoto) paper on the construction of myths around Japanese Nobel laureates and nominees.
         A deeper understanding of the Prize’s role in attempts to claim literary recognition
         for the purpose of shaping nationalistic narratives in the era of the Cold War would
         be central to challenge these myths and to contribute to new approximations to world
         literature, Inoue argued.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Hülya Yildiz</span> (Ankara) elaborated on the diverging paths towards the Nobel Prize for Orhan Pamuk,
         who eventually won it, and Yasar Kemal, who remained a favoured candidate. Her analysis
         paid special attention to »authorial position« and »translatability« as the distinctive
         factors responsible for Pamuk’s success. His positioning within prestigious institutions
         in America along with the Western themes of his novels gave him, according to Yildiz,
         an advantage against the »perceived provinciality« of Kemal’s work. <span style="font-weight:bold">Pablo Faúndez Morán’s</span> (Valparaiso) paper discussed the political appropriation of Nobel laureate Gabriela
         Mistrál in Chile in regard to different iconographies of the author that can be traced
         back through different political disputes in the country. Morán also presented a portrait
         of Mistrál on the official banknotes. As a material manifestation of the theoretically
         and ideologically charged relationship between symbolic and economic power this example
         provided the symposium with another entrance to the multitude of value discourses
         surrounding the Nobel Prize. <span style="font-weight:bold">Coletta Kandemiri</span> (Windhoek) gave insights on the reception and canonisation of what she called »the
         big four« of African literature, consisting of Wole Soyinka, Nagib Mahfouz, Nadine
         Gordimer and J.W. Coetzee, all of whom have been awarded the Nobel Prize. Despite
         criticism for writing in English instead of in a native language, which especially
         Soyinka was confronted with, his works and those of the other Nobel laureates have
         been largely distributed transnationally in African countries, with schools and other
         educational institutions being major instances of their reception. This circulation
         within African countries contributed to a construction of the four authors as intracontinental
         representatives of literature <span style="font-style:italic">from</span> and maybe even more <span style="font-style:italic">about</span> ›Africa‹.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Kerstin Bohne</span> (Oldenburg) brought up a surprising fact: so far, no Dutch author has received the
         Nobel Prize. What have all Dutch authors done wrong, Bohne asked? To answer this question,
         she works with the holdings of the Nobel Archive. For the Netherlands, she said, a
         reception beyond its borders is a great challenge. It is by no means sufficient that
         the texts are translated. Rather, what is crucial is the quality of the translation.
         At the same time, a text that is difficult to understand is difficult to judge. The
         quality and quantity of translations determine the chances of winning the Nobel Prize.
         Overall, the importance of symbolic capital is particularly evident in ›small language
         families‹. In a collective talk, <span style="font-weight:bold">Sandra Richter, </span><span class="markedcontent"><span style="font-weight:bold">Astghik</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">Antonyan</span><span style="font-weight:bold">, </span><span style="font-weight:bold">Dîlan</span> <span style="font-weight:bold">Çakir</span></span> et al. (Marbach/Stuttgart) determined whether the awarding of the Nobel Prize had
         an effect on translation projects. It can be validated that most translations follow
         after the Nobel Prize has been won. This is crucial because translations are instrumental
         in determining which works can be remembered. Again, some languages dominate the translation
         field. For the 
         <!--
                       p. -->book market, the Nobel Prize functions as a globally readable brand. <span style="font-weight:bold">Kathrin Yacavone</span> (Cologne) traced the visual side of the Nobel Prize. It quickly becomes apparent
         that photographs are a central medium of authorship and that portraits have a high
         symbolic value. In comparison, it becomes clear that the photographs of Nobel Prize
         winners in literature show a high degree of staging as well as a pronounced similarity.
         Diversity is not captured photographically. Instead, a prominent principle of representation
         is successively established. Indirectly, this promotes the corporate identity of the
         Swedish Academy. According to Yacavone, a reciprocal relationship of representation
         and idealisation is created, which ultimately serves to legitimise itself.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In his closing lecture, <span style="font-weight:bold">Pieter Vermeulen</span> (Leuven) focused on value creation and book design. Forms of book presentation prove
         to be a risk because a decision has to be made that is appropriate to the subject
         matter. This reveals how a book should appear to the reading public: sexy or serious.
         Moreover, besides the literary value, a whole bundle of values needs to be served:
         commercial, aesthetic, symbolic. These different values must be continuously produced
         and legitimised, the ultimate goal being prestige. ›World value‹ can only be understood,
         Vermeulen concluded, when situational practices and specific differences are examined.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The event concluded with a panel discussion between <span style="font-weight:bold">Michael Krüger</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Anders Olsson</span>, moderated by Jan Bürger. Krüger drew attention to the downside of the Prize, which
         he said was a hurdle for many authors: it is a burden to wait forever for the Nobel
         Prize and possibly never receive it. Olsson then emphasised that the Nobel Prize for
         Literature does not stand for a competitive model. It is primarily an instrument that
         can help broaden perspectives on literature and current issues. In addition, Krüger
         offered a different perspective to the well-known criticism that decision-making criteria
         are not made transparent. According to Krüger, it is the lack of transparency that
         makes the awarding of prizes so attractive. It is precisely this criterion that provokes
         discussions that benefit literature as a whole. This may be the reason for the sustainability
         of the award.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Discussions around the Nobel Prize as a stabiliser of historically universalised western
         perspectives on value and literature were prominent during the symposium. Several
         comments to the papers addressed the need to make truly global perspectives strong
         in order to imagine how reflections on prize culture and evaluation processes could
         contribute to a more diverse perception of literature in the future. The inertia of
         the prize and the persistence of its widely presumed global relevance was a controversial
         aspect throughout the discussions. Also, in view of the numerous sources, there were
         lively discussions about which (digital) methods of analysis are suitable and useful
         to address these questions. In their concluding outlook Spoerhase and Sneis summarised
         that further transdisciplinary research on literary prizes could deepen our understanding
         of how evaluation practices influence literature. The look at the <span style="font-style:italic">Literature in the Nobel Era</span> explained phenomena such as the translation boom and licence negotiations, but many
         aspects remain unexplored. Hence the symposium can be understood as a plea for further
         international, transdisciplinary (and also archive-based) research on literary prizes.
         The conveners expressed the aim to keep up the dialogue through further conferences
         and publication projects, this initial symposium however is deservedly already part
         of the history of the Nobel Prize in Literature, as the lectures have already been
         archived in the DLA Marbach.

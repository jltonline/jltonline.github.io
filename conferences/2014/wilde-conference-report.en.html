      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">1. Conference Topic</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The Winter School »Transmedial Worlds in Convergent Media Culture« examined the forms
         and functions of a wide variety of transmedial narratives from a range of different
         (inter-) disciplinary perspectives. An increasingly convergent media culture has given
         rise to complex entertainment franchises that transgress media borders, arranging
         narrative texts, films, television series, comics, and videogames (among others) into
         highly interconnected entertainment experiences as well as facilitating the participation
         of fans in the negotiation and re-appropriation of transmedial meaning(s)<span id="Note1_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. Call for Papers, University of Tuebingen Website, http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/philosophische-fakultaet/fachbereiche/philosophie-rheto…" href="#Note1">[1]</a></span>. The conference was divided up into four parts: the first, spanning four keynotes,
         focused on some base concepts and theoretical approaches, whereas the three consecutive
         parts (of two keynotes, respectively) were centered around specific media formations
         (television, comic books and videogames). Complementing the keynotes, junior researchers
         presented a number of thematically focused case studies on salient aspects of the
         Winter School’s theme that connected to the keynotes.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Even though the participants departed from different disciplinary backgrounds (media,
         literature, film or even game studies), a quite surprising unanimity set the tone,
         at least with regard to the selection of relevant works and studies concerning the
         underlying theoretical concepts: <span style="color:333333">David Herman’s </span><span class="pdf_RezJLT_Buchtitel_in_Haupttext_Zchn">Story Logic</span><span class="Emphasis"><span style="font-style:italic;color:333333">(</span></span><span style="color:333333">2004),</span> Henry Jenkins’ <span style="font-style:italic">Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide (</span>2006), Marie-Laure Ryan’s <span style="font-style:italic">Avatars of Story (2006)</span> and Mark J.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">2. Narrative Theory and Base Concepts surrounding Transmedia ›Worlds‹</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The conference was opened by <span style="font-weight:bold">Klaus Sachs-Hombach</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Jan-Noël Thon </span>(Tuebingen) with the keynote speech »Transmedial Worlds in Convergent Media Culture«.
         Taking the heading ›media convergence‹ as an entry point for the discussions, Sachs-Hombach
         elaborated on the dimensions of both conceptual elements: against the background of
         profound media changes in recent decades, a transformation of communicative dispositifs
         on technological, semiotic, institutional and content-oriented levels has been noted.
         Nonetheless, Sachs-Hombach argued, instead of a radical amalgamation of differentiated
         forms, distinctions between strategies of combining, interrelating or refining existing
         media-aspects can be observed. Subsequently, 
         <!--
                       p. -->Thon distinguished between fundamental concepts of storyworld-relations within transmedia-›universes‹,
         while also offering a survey of the present state of research. Proposing to, on principle,
         differentiate between adaptations, expansions and modifications of a given ›world‹,
         Thon argued for medium-specific theories of production, representation and comprehension.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The second keynote was held by <span style="font-weight:bold">Lisbeth Klastrup</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Susana P. Tosca </span>(Copenhagen) and traced the miscellaneous »Origins of Transmedial Worlds«. The speech
         focused less on commercial aspects but rather on issues of reception and creativity.
         Transmedial ›worlds‹, understood as ›abstract content systems shared by creators and
         audiences alike‹ (from which stories, characters or plot events can be actualized)
         can thus be seen as an invitation to engage creatively. Klastrup and Tosca thus turned
         their attention towards the concept of ›remix‹ as a possible alternative to that of
         ›adaptation‹, not tied to (or judged by) any fidelity to source material. Subsequently,
         they showed various differing roots and origins of such ›worlds‹, ranging from the
         ›fan love‹-aspects in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Sherlock Holmes</span> through Tolkien’s deliberate emphasis on fictional data (rather than on singular
         plots) up to the gradual transformation of ›inside jokes‹ into a Lovecraft-mythology.
         The ›worldness‹ of a narrative, they concluded, always involves the invitation to
         participate in one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Marie-Laure Ryan </span>(Boulder) addressed various topics of interest with her keynote speech »Transmedia
         Storytelling: Industry Buzzword or New Narrative Experience?«: With reference to the
         stated claim that storytelling would never be the same again under transmedial conditions,
         Ryan critically examined to what extent recent developments actually differ from older
         phenomena. Seen rather as aggregations of a number of different practices (some age-old,
         some not really transmedial by themselves), transmedia ›worlds‹ nonetheless intensify
         the differentiations between more story-centered narrations unfolding in time and
         more ›spatially‹ oriented ones. Some writers, genres, or even franchises seem more
         interested in presenting complex environments and in ›mapping‹ fictional places, institutions
         or interaction-structures than in developing a coherent story or characters. In that
         type of ›world‹, Ryan pointed out, distinct storylines serve only as access points
         or walkthroughs, if not mere pretenses; Another new focus of scholarly interest could
         lie in the different relations between the gaps and omissions of a ›mothership‹ (the
         main instalment of a storyworld) to the (relative) autonomy of any expansion accessed
         through those departing points.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Jens Eder </span>(Mannheim) presented a huge array of definitional and methodical approaches surrounding
         the term ›transmediality‹ in his keynote speech »Transmediality, Adaptation, Imagination:
         Concepts, Forms and Strategies«. Eder made the point that on all levels of media perception
         and interpretation an overlay of what is perceived with memories of earlier medial
         experiences must be taken into account. Additionally, these questions should not be
         restricted to fiction, but must also be applied to non-fictional and amateur forms,
         to journalism, advertisement, and education. Eder then turned the audience’s attention
         towards politically significant effects of transmedial practices, questioning whether
         it is appropriate to consider them enthusiastically as participatory or emancipatory,
         rather than observing a growing dominance of ›big players‹ and homogenization. Following
         the increasing structural disadvantages of genuinely alternative productions, the
         preeminence of market-conforming ›monomyths‹ should be kept under critical observation.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In workshops following the keynotes, participants discussed various case studies of
         exemplary phenomena – some of which seemed far away from canonic cases at first, thereby
         testing the range of the concepts put under scrutiny. <span style="font-weight:bold">Martin Stobbe</span> (Münster) and <span style="font-weight:bold">Theresa Schmidtke </span>(Rostock) proposed to re-read the gospels of the Bible (and their associated action
         figures) as one of the earliest cases of transmedial phenomena (»›Comes with removable
         stone tablets and shepherds staff‹: Contemporary Manifestations of the Bible as a
         Transmedial World«), while <span style="font-weight:bold">
            <!--
                       p. -->Laura Schlichting</span>(Gießen) continued to expand the field of reference with her contribution on the online-journalism
         project <span style="font-style:italic">Hollow:</span> »Non-Fictional Transmedial Storytelling and Web-Aware Journalism: A Case Study of
         <span style="font-style:italic">Hollow</span> (2013) created by Elaine McMillion«. <span style="font-weight:bold">Anna Weigel </span>(Gießen) discussed the interaction of Marisha Pessl’s novel <span style="font-style:italic">Night Film </span>with a downloadable mobile phone App (»Reframing the Concept of Transmedia Storytelling
         for Novel-Based Transmedial Worlds: An Analysis of Marisha Pessl’s <span style="font-style:italic">Night Film</span> (2013)«), while <span style="font-weight:bold">Vera Cuntz-Leng </span>(Berkeley/Mainz) elaborated on some of the potential pitfalls of transmedia-expansions
         in the <span style="font-style:italic">Harry Potter</span> ›online experience‹: »›<span style="font-style:italic">Pottermore</span> was our friend, and it betrayed us‹: Transmedia Storytelling, Audience Engagement,
         and Fan Alienation on <span style="font-style:italic">Pottermore</span>«. <span style="font-weight:bold">Krzysztof M. Maj </span>(Kraków) followed up on Ryan’s distinction between spatially vs. temporally centered
         ›worlds‹ with his presentation »Transfictional Storytelling in World-Building Narratives:
         The Role of Encyclopaedic Competence for Immersive Participation in Fictional Storyworlds«.
         With reference to Umberto Eco’s concept of <span style="font-style:italic">encyclopaedic competence</span><span id="Note4_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Umberto Eco, Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language, London 1984." href="#Note4">[4]</a></span>, Maj pointed out that – in many genre videogames – fictional ›worlds‹ serve as invitations
         to develop ›fields of reference‹ and expand our registers of (fictional) competence
         about the storyworlds’ background (rather than following distinct storylines <span style="font-style:italic">or</span> acting according to the game’s key objectives). <span style="font-weight:bold">Raphaela Knipp </span>(Siegen) pursued the ›spatial‹ aspects of transmediality even further in: »Transmedial
         Worlds and Fan Mobilities: What is to Be Found on the Spot Marked ›X‹?«: Discussing
         the phenomenon of ›fictional media-tourism‹ whereby people travel great distances
         to visit places somehow associated to fictional places, Knipp presented a variety
         of such ›mediated‹ pilgrimage sites. <span style="font-weight:bold">Christina Formenti </span>(Milan) opened subsequent questions in »Expanded Mockuworlds: Mockumentary as a Transmedial
         Narrative Style«. Formenti gave an overview about the development of different Mockumentary
         formats. The speaker pointed out to what extent the codes and conventions that we
         are used to read as references to ›reality‹ are reliant on transmedial practices and
         tactics. <span style="font-weight:bold">Sebastian Armbrust’s </span>(Hamburg) concluding observations in »<span style="font-style:italic">Mad Men</span> between Historical Fiction, Transmedial World and Pop-Culture Phenomenon« centered
         around a ›division of labour‹ between verbal and visual modalities, with only the
         former taking a critical or ironical stance towards <span style="font-style:italic">Mad Men</span>’s <span style="font-style:italic">mores</span>. In contrast, the visual designs mostly reinforce some kind of eroticization or nostalgia
         by means of the shows’ highly recognisable aesthetics, which must also be understood
         as part of <span style="font-style:italic">Mad Men</span>’s ›worldness‹.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">3. Narrative and Television</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">After the focus on broader theoretical and ontological issues, the conference addressed
         narrativity in specific media, starting with the changing dynamics and practices surrounding
         television and broadcasting.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Elizabeth Evans </span>(Nottingham) launched the discussion with her keynote speech »The Temporal Dynamics
         of Transmedia Television«. After an overview about British television’s gradual attempts
         to experiment with websites and mobile Apps during the last decade, Evans referred
         to the theoretical backdrops of Raymond Williams’ concept of ›flow‹<span id="Note5_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Raymond Williams, Television. Technology and Cultural Form, London 1974." href="#Note5">[5]</a></span> and John Ellis’ ›glance‹<span id="Note6_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="John Ellis, Visible Fictions: Cinema, Television, Video, London 1982." href="#Note6">[6]</a></span>. While, on the one hand, TV is said to become more and more ›cinematic‹ (with shows
         like <span style="font-style:italic">Sherlock</span> being watched most often on DVD boxes in a linear and repeatable fashion), shows
         like <span style="font-style:italic">The X Factor</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">Defiance</span>, on the other hand, try to reclaim a sense of immediate temporality in the audience’s
         engagement. With various Apps reacting on and interacting to exact broadcasting moments
         of the shows, we experience simultaneous instances of multiple screens layered on
         top of (and parallel to) each other. Voting for candidates in the ›fifth judge game‹
         (or for your favorite characters in <span style="font-style:italic">Defiance</span>), comparing your reactions to other user’s experiences, ordering sponsored pizza
         online during commercial breaks, or browsing for additional diegetic information:
         the audience is more and more compelled to engage in multiple 
         <!--
                       p. -->›micro-flows‹, understood as radically <span style="font-style:italic">time-based</span> experiences. Contrary to prior conceptions of ›glance‹ (that is, being easily distracted
         by events not related to television at all), this reclamation of ephemerality and
         ›liveness‹, Evans argued, reinforces broadcasting, the centerpiece of ›transmedia
         television‹.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Susanne Marschall </span>(Tuebingen) opened the second half of the TV-oriented considerations with her keynote
         »Non Finito: Fragmentary Worldbuilding in Transmedia Television«. Revising the Romantic
         notion of Schlegel’s ›fragment‹ – understood as part of a puzzle that couldn’t or
         shouldn’t be completed – Marschall investigated different ways in which the concept
         of a ›<span style="font-style:italic">Leerstelle</span>‹ (Iser)<span id="Note7_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Wolfgang Iser, Der implizite Leser, München 1979." href="#Note7">[7]</a></span> has migrated into contemporary TV’s aesthetics and narratives. Contrasting the disruptive
         and politically subversive fragmentation of Nina Paley’s <span style="font-style:italic">Sita Sings the Blues</span> (2008) with James Cameron’s syncretistic cultural amalgamation <span style="font-style:italic">Avatar</span> (2009) – the latter carefully covering its <span style="font-style:italic">sutures</span>, its gaps and holes, instead of revealing them – Marschall argued that most TV shows
         draw upon both sources. Non-linear, fragmentary plots provide more opportunities for
         viewers to contribute, be it in terms of branching out fan art/fan fictions, or in
         study and discussion of various intratexts (as in <span style="font-style:italic">Lostpedia</span>-like databases). Transmediality, in itself an enormous <span style="font-style:italic">Non Finito</span>, can therefore be discussed either to the paradigm of the hypertext – an artistically
         well-formed construction – or to that of Deleuze’s and Guattari’s notion of the rampantly
         growing <span style="font-style:italic">rhizome </span>(as in the non-linear interactions between producers, writers and fans alike in shows
         like <span style="font-style:italic">Lost</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">The Walking Dead</span>).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the workshops’ subsequent case studies, <span style="font-weight:bold">Jonas Nesselhauf </span>and <span style="font-weight:bold">Markus Schleich </span>(Saarbrücken) discussed ARTE/SWR’s <span style="font-style:italic">Zeit der Helden </span>(»A Stream of Medial Consciousness: Transmedial Storytelling in Contemporary German
         Quality Television«), while <span style="font-weight:bold">Amelie Zimmermann </span>(Passau/Turku) presented the highly metaleptic ARTE-show »<span style="font-style:italic">About:Kate:</span> Experimental TV between Transmedia Storytelling and Paratextual Structures«. In both
         cases, the presenters pointed out, a high degree of interactivity challenges the term
         ›paratext‹ with regard to the additional (website-, app- or social media-)content.
         <span style="font-weight:bold">Anne Ganzert </span>(Konstanz) pointed back towards one dawn of such transmedial audience interaction
         around 2006: »›We welcome you to your <span style="font-style:italic">Heroes</span> community. Remember, everything is connected.‹«. Finally, <span style="font-weight:bold">Jonathan A. Rose </span>(Berlin) made the contribution of ›fandom‹ activities to transmedia ›worlds‹ his primary
         object of research: »Crossovers and Fusions: Convergence in Online Fandom«: The realm
         of ›fandom‹ must be understood as a place where meaning is generated and modified,
         where cultural products are constantly re-evaluated in ways quite differently from
         (yet not entirely unrelated to) scholarly interest.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">4. Narrative and Comic Books</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Bernard Perron </span>(Montreal) opened the spotlight on comic book-based transmedial storytelling with
         his keynote speech »Wandering the Panels, Walking Through Media: Zombies, Comics and
         the Transmedial Postapocalyptic World«. Proposing to uniquely advance the study of
         medium specificity through closer looks at adaptations over media, Perron contrasted
         the aesthetics and the emotional appeal of a comparable scene in <span style="font-style:italic">The Walking Dead</span> throughout its comic book-, TV show- and the Telltale videogame-instalments. Arguing
         that the zombie genre is as much about separating, demarking and transgressing (safe
         or contaminated) spaces, as it is about movement through those spaces, Perron analysed
         parallels to the ›grammar‹ of segmented comic book frames and thresholds in that respect
         – very different from the more direct presentation of movement in film. Genre-defining
         transmedial motifs and standard situations, such as ›the bite‹ or ›the headshot‹,
         seem to transcend medium-specifity, even though their successful actualisation relies
         heavily on the potentials and limits of the given medium.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Stephan Packard </span>(Freiburg) presented the second keynote on the subject: »Closing the Open Signification:
         Transmedial Chronotopoi in Comics«. Building on the Bakhtinian concept of ›<span style="font-style:italic">chronotopos</span>‹<span id="Note8_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Michail M. Bachtin, Chronotopos, Frankfurt am Main 2008." href="#Note8">[8]</a></span>, Packard analysed the regulated connections between spatial representations, genre
         markers and narrative motifs in comic books. With examples ranging from the earliest
         <span style="font-style:italic">Spider-Man</span> crossovers to playful frictions between Marvel’s cinematic and comic book universe(s),
         he showed how ›convergence effects‹ (not necessarily tied to – but especially salient
         within – transmedial phenomena) point to negotiations between authorial ›masks‹ (supposed
         instances of narratorial intent) and the audience’s expectations about what (in a
         given storyworld) might be relevant or possible. Following this line of argument semiotically,
         Packard linked it to a fundamental distinction within the visual repertoire of comic
         book signs: between spatial markers on the one hand and (often ›cartoonized‹) objects
         of interaction and identification on the other.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the following case studies of the workshop, <span style="font-weight:bold">Hans-Christian Schmidt </span>(Cologne) scrutinized the suitability of a comic book-›text‹ to translate in different
         videogame genres (»›They are Everywhere!‹: <span style="font-style:italic">The Walking Dead</span> and Transmedia Worldbuilding«). <span style="font-weight:bold">Matteo Riatti </span>(Passau) focused on the character and the myth of the Batman in his various incarnations
         across media in: »The Joker, the Bat and the Integrity of Transmedial Narration«.
         <span style="font-weight:bold">Laura Oehme’s </span>(Bayreuth) presentation »The Transmedial World of/in <span style="font-style:italic">Watchmen</span>« focused not so much on the various film, animation and videogame expansions of Alan
         Moore and Dave Gibbon’s 1986/87 ›mothership‹ but rather on the textual heterogeneity
         of the source text itself. <span style="font-weight:bold">Johannes Fehrle’s </span>(Mannheim) concluding investigation on »Remediation as (Simulated) Transmedia World:
         The Case of <span style="font-style:italic">Scott Pilgrim</span>« focused on the many paradoxes surrounding the <span style="font-style:italic">histoire</span>/<span style="font-style:italic">discourse</span> distinction within the ›transmedially saturated world‹ <span style="font-style:italic">of Scott Pilgrim</span>: ›Ludic game mechanic‹-elements play a critical role within the film’s story, whereas
         in actual videogames it’s not quite clear whether they are even part of the represented
         ›world‹ at all.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">5. Narrative and Videogames</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The last focus of the conference was mostly dedicated to videogames. <span style="font-weight:bold">Espen Aarseth </span>(Copenhagen) gave the first keynote speech, which was intended to initiate many of
         the following discussions: »Transreality Game Worlds: Tracing the Signified across
         Media«. Insisting on a categorical difference between (fictional) narration, opposite
         to ›real‹ (albeit virtual) gaming, Aarseth promoted the idea of a ›ludo-realism‹:
         within that notion, the perceptible ›surfaces‹ of videogames signify conceptual game
         components, <span style="font-style:italic">ludemes</span>, i.e. game events. Since the matrix of any given videogame can generate an infinite
         amount of virtual ›worlds‹, Aarseth pointed out, we have to think about games as <span style="font-style:italic">meta</span>-<span style="font-style:italic">chronotropes</span> that only later serve as foundations for possible stories. The speaker went to demonstrate
         this with <span style="font-style:italic">MMORPG</span> (online multiplayer) phenomena, where people experience and perform ›real actions‹
         – regardless of what those might represent in terms of narrative. A comparison to
         the concept of <span style="font-style:italic">ludoforming</span> was touched upon, the ›gamification‹ of actual places. The discussion afterwards
         brought many additional issues to the table, questioning where problems such as chess,
         Shakespearean theatre or the stock market would fit within that model.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The last keynote of the conference was given by <span style="font-weight:bold">Benjamin Beil </span>(Cologne) on the topic: »Core-Gaming: Towards the Interactivation of Transmedial World«.
         Focusing on game-expansions of HBO’s series <span style="font-style:italic">Lost</span>, Beil examined the implications of their supposed shortcomings. Despite the fact
         that the series itself is often considered to ›draw on videogame conventions and structures‹,
         the questionable vagueness of such notions was criticized. Beil conceded that ›game
         logic‹ 
         <!--
                       p. -->assertions often rest upon grave misunderstandings about the nature of interactive
         narratives. With this in mind, he addressed some key problems of transmedia expansions:
         delivering paratext for paratexts’ sake while failing to transform a story’s emotional
         core into an interactive experience. As a counter-example, Beil discussed <span style="font-style:italic">Dear Esther</span>, initially released as a free source engine mod in 2008 (although mostly lacking
         all typical game-features). Drawing on a similiar motif to <span style="font-style:italic">Lost</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Dear Esther</span> at the same time reflects and deconstructs the process of explanatory coherence.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The last workshop on challenging case studies was opened up by <span style="font-weight:bold">Robert Baumgartner </span>(Munich): »›In the grim darkness of the far future there is only war‹: <span style="font-style:italic">Warhammer 40k</span> and the Issue of Change and Stasis in Transmedial Franchises«. <span style="font-weight:bold">Nieves Rosendo </span>(Granada) then turned the audience’s attention once again towards the changing role
         of fan participation in the canon-building of major franchises: »The Map is not the
         Territory: Canon and the Transmedial World of <span style="font-style:italic">Halo</span>«. <span style="font-weight:bold">Martin Hennig’s </span>(Passau) subsequent presentation (»Why Some Worlds Fail: Dysfunctional Transmedial
         Convergences in the <span style="font-style:italic">Resident Evil</span>- and <span style="font-style:italic">Silent Hill</span>-Universes«) traced the mutual influences and resulting modifications of the franchises
         in question – from initial videogames to cinema-adaptations, back into consecutive
         versions of games. The last presentation of the conference was given by <span style="font-weight:bold">Felix Schröter </span>(Hamburg): »The Game of <span style="font-style:italic">Game of Thrones</span>: The Transmedial World of <span style="font-style:italic">A Song of Ice and Fire</span> and Its Video Game Adaptions«. The audience was presented with the question if a
         specific choice of game genre might already constitute an interpretation of a given
         ›world’s‹ <span style="font-style:italic">ethos</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">While it is impossible to sum up a conference with such a broad scope, connecting
         very fundamental and theoretical questions with detailed close-readings, some points
         are worth noting: Many of the phenomena in question expanded the field of reference
         far beyond what is traditionally considered the domain of narrative theory – action
         figures, real world-tourist destinations or <span style="font-style:italic">Tumblr</span>-fan artworks, to name just a few. Yet, many fundamental narratological concepts (as
         the <span style="font-style:italic">histoire/discourse</span>-distinction) still proved instrumental even in the more eccentric cases. It became
         clear that there arises a challenge for scholars, however, to decide which of the
         countless properties of a given medial instalment should be taken into account as
         ›storyworld‹-relevant – or solely as means of representation. The <span style="font-style:italic">Lego Star Wars</span> videogames, for instance, established themselves as recurring ›test cases<a id="_DdeLink__28_566443425">
            <!--anchor--></a>‹: whether the ›Legoness‹ of this (<span style="font-style:italic">Star Wars</span>) re-narration should be regarded as a modification of content provided some food
         for discussion; as did the problem, whether ›1up‹-extra lives in videogames are to
         be dismissed as <span style="font-style:italic">external</span> to the ›content system‹ – or even central in ›unnatural narrations‹ like Super Mario
         World. What became clearer in the debates, however, is a general shift from product-oriented
         to process-oriented forms of narratives, surrounding fan cultures and their influences
         on major franchises as well as all kinds of participatory engagement and subversion.
         One of the major challenges therefore consists in the critical application of our
         terms and concepts to these transformations, without falling into the trap of prescriptive
         judgements.

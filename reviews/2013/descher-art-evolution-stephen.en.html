      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Titel_Rezension">Art and Evolution Reconsidered: Stephen Davies on the Possible Connections between
         Art and Evolution
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">Stephen Davies: The Artful Species. Aesthetics, Art, and Evolution. Oxford: Oxford

      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Whatever the differences may be: people of all nations, cultures and social classes
         are in one way or another engaged in the arts. Art behaviour – »the practices of creation,
         presentation, reception, and appreciation of art« (117) – has a long history dating
         back to the Upper Palaeolithic where the first unquestionable works of art originated,
         it is a universal phenomenon spread across the globe, and that calls for an explanation
         in terms of evolution. Accordingly, many of the recent debates in evolutionary aesthetics
         have focused on questions such as the following: What is the origin of art or of particular
         art forms like music or literature? To what extent do our aesthetic preferences have
         biological underpinnings? What is the evolutionary status of art behaviour? What kind
         of story can plausibly be told about the connection between art and evolution? Does
         art behaviour in any way contribute to the evolution of the human species? In his
         recent book <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Buchtitel_in_Haupttext_Zchn">The Artful Species</span> the philosopher Stephen Davies, well-known particularly for his important contributions
         to the philosophy of art, sets out to »investigate possible connections between evolution,
         art, and aesthetics.« (6) Of course, Davies is not the first to do this. Nowadays,
         the field of evolutionary aesthetics is crowded by scholars coming from all kinds
         of disciplines (biology, psychology, anthropology, neuroscience, cognitive science,
         archaeology, literary studies, and many more) and there is an enormous and still growing
         body of literature on the topic – just think of seminal works like Dutton’s <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Buchtitel_in_Haupttext_Zchn">The Art Instinct</span>, or (particularly devoted to literature) Boyd’s <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Buchtitel_in_Haupttext_Zchn">On the Origin of Stories</span>, and Gottschall and Wilson’s <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Buchtitel_in_Haupttext_Zchn">The Literary Animal</span>. The merit of Davies’s book is not that it would propose yet another startling, brand-new
         theory about the relation between art, our aesthetic senses, and evolution. Rather,
         it is an important contribution to evolutionary aesthetics simply because the author
         does what philosophers do best: He takes a careful look at prominent answers given
         to those questions, scrutinises prevalent arguments and gives them a nuanced and well
         balanced assessment.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The book has gained a lot of attention and is widely discussed. In this review I will
         just briefly give a general overview of the book and then, according to the scope
         of this journal, basically focus on the connection between evolution and art, especially
         between evolution and the creation and consumption of narrative fictions. Readers
         interested in aspects of the book not covered in this review will find links to other
         reviews on a weblog Davies runs in order to provide further information and keep track
         of the discussions.<span id="Note1_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="http://artfulspecies.wordpress.com/ – The blog provides web resources (e.g. a list of links to pictures of the artworks discussed in the book) and li…" href="#Note1">[1]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span class="pdf_RezJLT_Buchtitel_in_Haupttext_Zchn">The Artful Species</span> divides into three main parts. Part I introduces the key concepts, namely ›art‹,
         ›aesthetic‹, and ›evolution‹. Davies does not try to give full-fledged definitions
         of these concepts. However, he needs some kind of working-definitions to get started.
         According to Davies, »[a]esthetic experience involves awareness and appreciation of
         something’s aesthetic properties« (9), these properties being in a very broad classification
         the properties of ›beauty‹ and the ›sublime‹ and their opposites. What is encompassed
         by the concept of ›art‹ is characterised as follows:
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext">[S]omething is art (a) if it falls under an established, publicly recognized category
         of art or within an established art tradition, or (b) if it is intended by its maker/presenter
         to be art and its maker/presenter 
         <!--
                       p. -->does what is necessary and appropriate to realizing that intention, or (c) if it shows
         excellence of skill and achievement in realizing significant aesthetic or artistic
         goals. (28f.)
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This disjunctive account of art is very broad and includes prehistoric cave paintings
         and the infamous »sexy hand axe« as well as pop music, symphonies, paintings, dance
         performances, novels, and TV-series. But this does not imply that there are no differences
         between high and low, good and bad art, genres, styles, etc. The point is that these
         differences simply do not matter when you are looking for a connection between art
         and evolution. You may specify ›art‹ in a much narrower way and exclude everything
         that does not meet your standards. But if you are looking for an informative answer
         to the question how art behaviour and evolution are connected, it is reasonable not
         to be too restrictive about what counts as art and what does not.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Part II discusses the relation between our aesthetic senses and evolution, particularly
         our aesthetic responses to non-human animals, to landscapes, and to human beauty.
         All these responses, Davies argues, are at least partly explained by reference to
         biological evolution. This part contains many worthwhile discussions on these issues
         – especially Davies’s treatment of the aesthetic responses to non-human animals may
         be highly illuminating to anyone who has ever been puzzled about the continuous boom
         of »cute kitten videos« on YouTube and other related phenomena. But in what follows
         I will mainly focus on the contents of Part III.<span id="Note2_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Readers looking for an extended discussion of the contents of Part II may find an excellent article by Anton Killin helpful: Anton Killin, The Arts a…" href="#Note2">[2]</a></span> This last part examines the connection between art behaviour and evolution, and discusses
         several theories that try to classify art behaviour as either an adaptation (i.e.
         a behaviour that enhances fitness, that is the potential for surviving and reproductive
         success), a spandrel (i.e. a by-product of an adaptation with no evolutionary function
         itself), or a technology (i.e. a non-evolutionary, but merely cultural product like
         the ability to make and control fire).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">1. General Theories of Art and Evolution</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">One of the main purposes of the book is to evaluate prominent theories that answer
         the following question: Does art have an adaptive function, is it a by-product of
         evolution, or is it a merely culturally invented ›technology‹? Davies distinguishes
         <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">general</span> theories about the connection between art and evolution from <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">art-form-specific</span> theories that restrict their claims not to art in general, but to particular art
         forms like music, painting, dance, literature, and so on. (123) He also stresses that
         there is a condition that every theory about the connection between art behaviour
         and evolution must meet: »Ideally, to establish a strong, art-specific connection
         with evolution, art-general theories should identify an evolutionary significant function
         performed not only by <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">all</span> the arts but also by <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">only</span> the arts.« (123) Davies is not convinced that any of the current theories meets this
         requirement, and I will roughly summarise his arguments. Subsequently, I will turn
         to his assessment of theories concerning the connection between evolution and narrative
         fiction as a specific form of art.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The first view maintains that all art forms serve an adaptive function. Current versions
         of the adaptation view – held by, for example, Ellen Dissanayake who thinks that art
         is a way of »making things special«, Geoffrey Miller who thinks that art behaviour
         serves the function of sexual selection, and others – are criticised for failing to
         identify an adaptation that is specific to art behaviour. Of course, art can have
         many different functions and much can be said about why and in what different ways
         art behaviour can be beneficial to individuals or groups. But this alone is not sufficient
         to establish art behaviour as having a distinctive adaptive function.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The second view – most prominently defended in Steven Pinker’s <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Buchtitel_in_Haupttext_Zchn">How the Mind Works</span><span id="Note3_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Steven Pinker, How the Mind Works, New York 1997." href="#Note3">[3]</a></span> – maintains that art and art behaviour is a spandrel, a by-product of evolution.
         The prime 
         <!--
                       p. -->examples of spandrels are biological features like male nipples and human navels –
         by-products of evolution that seem to serve no evolutionary function. So, is art in
         this respect on a par with male nipples and navels? According to Davies, this view
         is not less problematic than the adaptation view, mainly for two reasons: First, even
         if art behaviour initially may have emerged as a by-product of evolution, it could
         not plausibly have remained a spandrel »because of the significant role it plays in
         human life.« (144) Here is Davies:
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext">If art behaviors came to us as ancillary evolutionary by-products, they would not
         remain merely incidental. Their occurrence in the usual manner would become <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_Hervorheb_kursiv">normative</span> because they provide honest, because costly, signals of ﬁtness. As a result, not
         only the absence of art behaviors but also the degrees to which they are represented
         can be <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_Hervorheb_kursiv">informationally signiﬁcant in assessing someone’s ﬁtness</span>. (145 – my emphasis)
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">So Davies’s thesis – he calls it »from form to norm« (144) – is this: Even if art
         behaviour initially had no function when it first emerged as a mere spandrel, it consequently
         became normative as a reliable signal of fitness. It is a signal of fitness because
         engagement in the arts requires intelligence, creativity, skilfulness, leisure (there
         is no time for art when looking for food is a full-time job), etc. And it is reliable
         because it is costly, it needs time, it needs the development and practice of skills,
         and so on. But note that even if art behaviour can be a reliable sign of fitness in
         various ways, this alone does not make it adaptive. To be adaptive, this function
         should be art specific. But obviously, there is a variety of non-artistic behaviours
         that perform that function as well.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Another reason for Davies’s critique of spandrel views is particularly interesting
         because he points to a condition for those views that is easily overlooked: To establish
         the spandrel view is even more demanding than the adaptation view. Because even if
         it were true »that art originally was a by-product of other adaptive behaviors, this
         does not show that art behaviors have not subsequently taken on adaptive functions
         in their own right.« Therefore: »Spandrels can be confidently identified as such only
         after the possibility that they are adaptations is tested and defeated.« (144) Thus,
         the burden of proof is even higher for proponents of the spandrel view.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The third view, art as a technology, maintains that art is a mere product of culture.
         Of course, in some sense <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">all</span> behaviour is based on our biological and genetic setting. But the technology view
         holds that technologies are tied to biology only in a very loose fashion and are independent
         of evolved art-specific capacities. Technologies, Davies explains, »are learned via
         culture and are achieved by us, rather than being genetically transmitted.« (148)
         This view, though, is dismissed rather quickly. According to Davies, it does not allow
         for co-evolutionary accounts of art, i.e. theories that treat art as a product of
         both biological and cultural evolution. In this respect it is too restrictive and
         reductive. Art is different from other technologies like the ability of making fire
         which is indeed culturally transmitted from generation to generation and does not
         seem to be either an adaptation or a spandrel, though of course it affected the evolution
         of the human species.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This does not look very promising. And indeed: »If <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">technology</span>, <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">spandrel</span> and <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">adaptation</span> exhaust the logical space of possibilities, as I believe they do, it looks as if
         something has gone wrong.« (184) But it has not. Davies’s answer to the question whether
         art is an adaptation, a spandrel, or a technology is simply this: We do not know for
         sure. Although the third view – the view that art is a mere product of culture, an
         invented and culturally transmitted technology not affected by biological evolution
         and <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">vice versa</span> – is ruled out as entirely implausible, Davies does not conclude that adaptation
         or spandrel views are wrong in principle. His point is that, up to now, none of the
         theories considered can count as proved. The logical requirements for those theories
         are hardly met, the available evidence is weak in 
         <!--
                       p. -->many cases – Davies is aware of the fact that most of what we think »was true in prehistory«
         is inevitably speculative (184; see also 43) – and sometimes one and the same hypothesis
         may lend support to more than one of the competing theories. What the book accomplishes
         in the first place is not to give answers to all the questions that arise in the context
         of art and evolution, but to point out which widely held views are problematic and
         for what reasons, which arguments do not work and where more work is to be done. This
         Socratic attitude, as you may call it, is characteristic for the whole book and Davies’s
         treatment of many views current in evolutionary aesthetics. (Another good example
         is his critique of the »savanna hypothesis« (96ff.) – the thesis that we have a preference
         for savanna-like landscapes because it was the African savannas to which our human
         ancestors became adapted.) And as Davies rightly points out: »We do not need to settle
         that issue, however, before we can conclude that art behaviors serve as informationally
         rich indicators of many dimensions of human fitness.« (119)
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">2. Narrative Fictions and Evolution</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The arts – music, painting, sculpture, dance, literature, etc. – obviously differ
         from each other. They employ different media, can be consumed in different situations
         and circumstances, and they address such different capacities (like visual perception
         in the case of painting, language-processing in the case of literature) that it is
         hard and probably impossible to see which, if any, specific evolutionary function
         they all may jointly perform. Thus, if general theories cannot stand up to scrutiny,
         perhaps theories about particular art forms can. So let us turn to literature or,
         more precisely, narrative fictions (for convenience, I will use both terms interchangeably).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">What is the connection between literature and evolution? The most prominent view is
         that literary behaviour – the creation, consumption and appreciation of narrative
         fictions – serves an adaptive function. Davies examines a variety of different proposals
         to establish this view and I will not go through all of them, but to sum up, there
         are mainly three lines of argument in favour of this account. The first argument is
         that literature is a genuine source of information. Consuming narrative fictions can
         be instructive in many ways. We can gain knowledge from them, may learn a great deal
         about social relations and the way humans think, feel, and act. In addition, narrative
         fictions »provide worlds that can be imaginatively explored without generating real-world
         risks and consequences.« (168) The second argument is that particularly the creation
         of fiction is a reliable indicator of fitness. Someone who is engaged in the creation
         of narrative fictions can thereby show their intelligence, their skills, their wit,
         their experience, their creativity, etc. And this, so the argument goes, serves for
         gaining social status, attracting possible mates, and so for sexual selection. The
         third argument is that literature is beneficial to the group because it is a helpful
         vehicle for establishing certain values, promoting or denouncing certain patterns
         of behaviour, increasing group cohesion, etc.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">As for the first argument, Davies has a battery of counter arguments and I will only
         mention those which strike me as the most important. First of all, he admits that
         we can learn from narrative fictions. However, echoing the main argument against general
         theories of art as an adaptation, Davies argues that although some and perhaps most
         narrative fictions undeniably have informational value as they are exploring and illuminating
         important aspects of human life, this still does not prove that literature is adaptive.
         To be adaptive, these benefits should be specific to literary behaviour, which they
         are obviously not. We do not need narrative fictions (with emphasis on »fictions«)
         to gain knowledge about the way humans think, feel, 
         <!--
                       p. -->and act. On the contrary, factual narratives about real people and real events may
         serve this function even better.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">There is the further worry that – even if we can gain genuine knowledge about the
         real world from fictions – all we may learn could still be simple platitudes (»crime
         does not pay!«) that barely contribute to the refinement of our social skills. Those
         platitudes may be too general and too abstract to be of significant practical value
         in dealing with other human beings. Narrative fictions may even »miseducate« us. (170)
         They may deceive and persuade us of things that are simply wrong. And indeed, the
         acquisition of false beliefs does not seem to be a promising way for enhancing our
         fitness.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">As for the second argument, Davies rightly emphasises that »much fictional narrating
         takes place under conditions in which mate selection is not at issue«. (166) In addition,
         there is no empirical evidence for the thesis that authors of fiction are more successful
         in spreading their genes and producing significantly more children than others. Actually,
         in the case of music, a study of European male composers from the last six centuries
         indicates exactly the opposite direction. (126)
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">As for the third argument, Davies admits that a lot of narrative fictions can have
         beneficial impact on the group. But it is also true that many of them do not: Literary
         fictions may even serve opposite ends and recommend values and patterns of behaviour
         that are destructive for the group. Furthermore, proponents of this argument seem
         to be committed to the theory of group selection (the theory that groups, not only
         individuals, are the units of evolutionary selection) which seems to be incompatible
         with the classical Darwinism most of them embrace. (167f.)
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">However, Davies’s principal critique of Literary Darwinists that try to establish
         literary behaviour as an adaptation – often professors of literature, as Davies mentions
         more than once – is this: First, even if they are right in highlighting that literature
         has an important informational value and literary behaviour is beneficial in various
         respects that alone still does not make it adaptive. To be adaptive, these benefits
         should be specific. Second, Literary Darwinists »hardly ever take seriously the need
         to establish that the benefits in question outweigh the costs and that the allegedly
         adaptive characteristics are heritable.« (162) I doubt, though, that it poses serious
         difficulties for adaptationists to show that the benefits of literary behaviour outweigh
         the costs. Of course, the production and consumption of narrative fictions may not
         be pleasurable from start to finish. It takes time, it draws the attention away from
         »the real world«, it can isolate you from the community, and so on. But if fiction
         really <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">has</span> the benefits that adaptationists claim for it (and Davies in most cases does not
         doubt those benefits), then this seems to be sufficient to show that it is worth and
         rewarding to engage in it. The second point from the passage just quoted is more important:
         If literary behaviour is adaptive, then it must be shown that the dispositions and
         capacities that literary behaviour relies on are not only genetically transmitted,
         but that literary behaviour is »causally responsible for them.« (171) And it is hard
         to see how that hypothesis could be corroborated.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">If, after all, literary behaviour cannot be classified as an adaption, perhaps spandrel-theories
         can provide a better understanding of the connection between evolution and the behaviour
         in question. Davies briefly discusses one single theory proposed by William Flesch.
         According to Flesch, human beings have the evolved capacity to track the behaviour
         of others. Fiction »recruits« this important capacity. (143) It makes use of it and
         can itself be used as a tool for monitoring possible social relations. Yet, according
         to the theory, it does <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">not</span> have the function of improving this capacity. Therefore, literary behaviour is not
         adaptive, but a by-product of certain social competencies. Davies’s critique of this
         proposal is twofold: First, there is the 
         <!--
                       p. -->obvious fact that not all narrative fictions deal with »themes concerning social coordination
         and management«. (ibid.) Second and more important, proponents of both accounts –
         those claiming that literature is a spandrel, or that it is adaptive – often draw
         different conclusions from the same premises. Both argue for their respective view
         by pointing out that, for example, narrative fictions have the function of monitoring
         and illuminating social relations. But Davies rightly draws our attention to the fact
         that these hypotheses, even if true, are compatible with both views.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">There is another pertinent question concerning the relation between the theory of
         evolution and literature: To what extent does the theory of evolution bear on the
         interpretation of works of literature? Most of the time Davies remains silent about
         this issue (and perhaps for good reason because there might not be much to tell).
         Nevertheless, he makes an interesting comment on attempts to interpret certain works
         of literature from the perspective of evolutionary psychology. (161f.) And indeed,
         the culture-invariant existence of certain pertinent plot types and themes like ›love‹,
         ›jealousy‹, ›rivalry‹, and so on call for an explanation in terms of the evolutionary
         history of the human mind. There are good reasons to think that the important role
         these themes play in our and our ancient forebears’ lives can provide such an explanation.
         Davies does not quarrel with those who try to explain the pervasiveness of certain
         plot types and themes by appeal to the evolved nature of the human mind. However,
         he criticises attempts to tie those interpretations (if you want to call these explanations
         ›interpretations‹) to the attribution of literary value. The appeal to evolution may
         have explanatory power concerning the question <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">why</span> so many works of fiction constantly deal with those themes. But the fact that a particular
         work of literature exhibits and explores a certain theme clearly does not make it
         good or bad. Interestingly enough, Davies concedes that there are certain exceptions.
         For example, he maintains that »psychological plausibility is almost always an artistic
         plus« in narrative fictions. (162) Therefore, interpretive studies from the viewpoint
         of evolutionary psychology may be relevant »for demonstrating the insights and sensitivities
         of literary authors, which is pertinent to measuring their achievements.« (ibid.)
         But I wonder if this argument really shows that an appeal to evolution can contribute
         to literary <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">interpretations</span>. It is true that, from an evolutionary perspective, it is an advantage to know what,
         why, and how humans think, feel, and act, and this may be an explanation of our interest
         in fictions that explore how humans think, feel, and act in different situations.
         And indeed, part of what can make a work of fiction good is that its author makes
         us understand (at least to some degree) how and why the fictional characters act the
         way they do.<span id="Note4_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="I say that with some reluctance. Is it »psychologically plausible« that Walter White in the TV-series Breaking Bad, being faced with cancer, stops be…" href="#Note4">[4]</a></span> But that, I think, does not tell us much about the interpretation of narrative fictions.
         It tells us something about ourselves, our evolved interests, desires and preferences,
         and so it may explain why we value particular works of literature for certain features
         and achievements.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">3. Conclusion</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span class="pdf_RezJLT_Buchtitel_in_Haupttext_Zchn">The Artful Species</span> stands out for its exceptionally clear style, carefully crafted arguments and the
         author’s familiarity with a massive body of relevant literature from various areas
         of research: about a third of the book is devoted to endnotes, a glossary, the list
         of references, and a helpful index. Readers of the book will learn a lot from it,
         whether they may agree with the conclusions of the author or not. Furthermore, Davies
         is not engaged in making politics. He correctly points out that – whatever a particular
         art form may be: an adaptation, a spandrel, or a technology – none of these theories,
         even if they were true, would make that art form more or less valuable for us. Contrary
         to what some authors in the field may think – Davies gives some examples (121f.) –
         the value of any form of art (and, consequently, the value of the respective scholarly
         disciplines studying these art forms) does not depend on its 
         <!--
                       p. -->evolutionary function. Of course, others made this point before.<span id="Note5_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. Steven Pinker, Toward a Consilient Study of Literature, Philosophy and Literature 31:1 (2007), 162–178, 169f." href="#Note5">[5]</a></span> Nevertheless, I think it is a significant one and worth to be emphasised.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">But the particular virtue of the book is that Davies is very careful in making his
         judgments. A recurring theme of the book is the insistence on the lack of empirical
         evidence and on the logical requirements that must be met before a certain view can
         be established. Accordingly, the author is often reluctant to give conclusive answers
         to the questions that arise in the context of art and evolution. This attitude that
         I have called Socratic strikes me as particularly appropriate in an area of research
         that is prone to overestimating the explanatory force of an appeal to evolution used
         to elucidate all the various aspects of our engagement with the arts. <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Buchtitel_in_Haupttext_Zchn">The Artful Species</span> advocates a more modest stance. Evolution may tell us a lot of interesting things
         about our relation to art: Why we value it, why certain themes and plots are of particular
         interest to us, why art and specific art forms are universal, how art and specific
         art forms can contribute to our lives, which functions they may perform, and so on.
         But it may not be the <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">explanans</span> for everything that puzzles us about art and its place in our world.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">However, for all the brilliance in style and clarity of arguments the structure of
         the book is not convincing in every detail. For example, as mentioned above, Davies
         distinguishes general theories from art-specific theories. But, in a chapter entitled
         »Art as a Technology« (Ch. 10), the only theory that is subjected to scrutiny is Aniruddh
         Patel’s theory of music as a technology. Davies just vaguely indicates that Patel’s
         view could be extended to a theory about art behaviour in general. (150) But that
         is a minor criticism. <span style="font-style: italic">The Artful Species</span> is an important contribution to evolutionary aesthetics, accessible for both newcomers
         in the field as well as experts. Newcomers will benefit from its remarkable readability,
         the introduction and careful evaluation of a vast range of competing accounts, and
         the fact that all pivotal concepts and theories are introduced, explained and often
         illustrated by examples. Specialists will profit from the great clarity, the detailed
         criticism of numerous theories, and the emphasis laid on the requirements that theories
         about the connection between art and evolution must meet in order to count as justified.

               cruel drug lord, killing and threatening almost everybody who gets in his way? You
               may doubt that. Of course, there are reasons for his behaviour and his decisions,
               but they will strike most of us at least as strange and unfamiliar. But this »psychological
               unusualness«, the fact that his behaviour is plausible only to some degree, seems
               to be one of the reasons why the series is an excellent and valuable work of art.
               Too much psychological plausibility could make a work ordinary and even boring. And
               this should be true of many narrative fictions, whatever the medium may be. <a class="Hyperlink back" href="#Note4_return">

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Titel_Rezension">A Mixed Methods Research Design for a Reader Response Based Analysis of Genre Expectations</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch" lang="de" translate="no">Benjamin Gittel, Fiktion und Genre. Theorie und Geschichte referenzialisierender Lektürepraktiken
         1870–1910. Berlin/Boston: De Gruyter 2021. 460 p. [Price: USD 163,86 / EUR 109,95].
         ISBN: 978-3-11-073796-7.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">One of the challenging aspects of Digital Humanities book publications is their hybridity
         concerning methods and their style of reasoning and writing. Benjamin Gittel’s book
         <span style="font-style:italic">Fiktion und Genre. Theorie und Geschichte referenzialisierender Lektürepraktiken 1870
            – 1910</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">Fiction and Genre. Theory and History of Referencing Reading Practices from 1870 to
            1910</span>) exhibits its hybridity by making its mixed methods explicit. The monograph investigates
         how readers generate relations between fiction and the real world based on genre expectations.
         For this, Gittel includes four fields of research: (1) literary theory, (2) annotation-based,
         historical reader-response analysis, (3) descriptive and inferential statistical analysis,
         and (4) social literary history within the frameworks of praxeology and mixed methods
         research. While each field of research has developed its own style of reasoning, writing
         at the intersection of different fields is challenging because it requires authors
         to develop new styles. As reflected by the discussions on mixed methods research,
         this is not only a matter of presentation but also one of methodology. Therefore,
         this book review is intended to discuss not only the book’s impact on each of the
         four research fields, but to look at the ways the monograph integrates the different
         fields of research.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">To prevent readers of the book from false expectations, I would like to clarify a
         potential ambiguity in the scope of Gittel’s book. Although it starts from a deliberate
         notion of praxeology and positions itself in the field of praxeological research,
         it turns out that its interest in reading practices focuses on cognitive procedures
         that have counted as heuristics or presumptions in hermeneutics. Recent scholarly
         perspectives, however, are often interested in literary practices covering even more
         practical actions including rigid activities such as prohibition, censorship, or public
         intimidation. While such a broader notion of practice is certainly relevant to late
         19<sup>th</sup>-century culture, Gittel does not analyze actions beyond semantic expectations. However,
         with regard to the book’s particular interest in genre expectations, this narrow focus
         is well founded. Therefore, this note is not meant as a critique but as a hint to
         prevent readers from not having their expectations met.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The book is organized around its central hypothesis that there are genre-specific
         reading practices that establish the way readers relate texts to the world. The empirical
         verification and examination of this hypothesis are developed in ten chapters. The
         first four chapters focus on theory and methodology, while chapters five to seven
         present case studies on different subgenres of the late 19<sup>th</sup>-century novel (<span style="font-style:italic">Historischer Roman</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Tendenzroman</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Zeitroman</span>). A first synthesis relates the empirical results to selected historical perspectives
         (chapter 8). Chapters nine and ten can be considered as a two-part conclusion in the
         form of a pilot study on the <span style="font-style:italic">Schlüsselroman</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">roman à clef</span>) around the year 2000 and a summary of the results from the perspective of social
         literary history.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Following the composition of the book, I start with its theoretical part. The first
         chapter clarifies the analytical terms that will be used throughout this study. The
         second chapter establishes the praxeological and socio-historical framework, whereas
         the third chapter translates theoretical
         <!--
                       p. -->terms and relations to annotation categories. Lastly, the fourth chapter elaborates
         on a mixed methods research design. Two major goals seem to overlap in these first
         chapters: that of introducing theoretical macro models to be used in the subsequent
         analyses, and that of revising several of these macro models themselves within the
         field of literary theory.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Regarding the first goal and based on the concepts of social practice, social institution,
         rule, and convention, Gittel clarifies the concepts of literary practice and the literary
         institution. These clarifications are important for his analyses and valuable for
         socio-historical literary studies in general. Moreover, he provides a rational reconstruction
         of Fricke’s distinction between text type (<span style="font-style:italic">Textsorte</span>) and genre. Gittel’s definition of text types as generalizations over textual features
         in contrast to genres as generalizations over expectations can be regarded as a new
         and fruitful approach for research on literary genres. Remarkably, text type and genre
         are used here in an exclusively synchronic way. This contrasts with the more popular
         dichotomy between a transhistorical mode (Genette) or <span style="font-style:italic">Schreibweise</span> (Hempfer) that denotes types in the systematic description language versus genres
         as historical manifestations of text types. Gittel’s explication is consistent. It
         ignores, however, the need for historical models of historical change and the evolution
         of genres. As the historical perspective in the final synthesis (chapter 8) covers
         the change only with regard to the practice of fictionality but not of genres, the
         terminological choices may be sufficient for the book’s goals. However, the historical
         change in genre expectations is not covered by Gittel’s theoretical framework. It
         must be addressed and elaborated on in future work. Regarding the second theoretical
         goal of revising institutional accounts of literature and fiction, Gittel enters a
         complex discussion of literary theory without engaging in the details of preceding
         controversies. It seems to me that, while Lamarque’s and Olsen’s institutional account
         of literature is examined in detail in the subsequent case studies and revised from
         an empirical perspective, theories of fictionality are just used in the following
         analyses instead of being revised.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The third chapter derives a comprehensive schema of relations between fictional discourse
         and fictional worlds on the one hand, and real-world entities on the other hand. These
         relations include denotation, instantiation, and exemplification between propositions
         and facts, as well as between objects and classes. These abstract relations result
         in seven main types of references including object reference, instantiation, exemplification,
         class identity, explicit as well as implicit truths, and isomorphism. While not all
         possible sub-relations – which are listed in the book but not reported here – are
         eventually used in the subsequent empirical analyses, the main types are substantial
         for developing relevant annotation categories in the empirically central step of the
         book.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The fourth chapter embeds the process of annotating 363 historical reviews from the
         late 19<sup>th</sup> century on fifteen novels assigned to the four mentioned text types into a sequential
         explanatory mixed methods design. By sequential explanatory design, Gittel refers
         to a primarily hypothesis-driven quantitative approach including statistical analyses
         followed by qualitative interpretations and illustrative extensions that shall elucidate
         details and aspects that could not be answered by the quantitative study. The statistical
         analyses will not be evaluated in detail here. As the book analyzes only a limited
         range of data, discussions about best practices of statistical inference should be
         brought forward by professional statisticians. Gittel justifies his choice of different
         data and variable types, tests, and assumed distributions with exemplary diligence.
         Moreover, Gittel also considers possible – and more or less – reasonable and likely
         objections. In this respect, Gittel imports a virtue that is characteristic of analytic
         literary theory into the style of discussing empirical methodology and thereby provides
         a model of hybrid mixed methods writing to the Digital Humanities. I shall return
         to two relevant objections at the end of this review.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->There is, however, one shortcoming concerning data collection and annotation that
         Gittel does not explicitly anticipate. Due to the limited research funds, it is understandable
         that annotations were not embedded in the historical reader-response documents and
         that these documents are not provided as machine-readable documents. Instead, the
         resulting annotations are made accessible only in a tabular format separate from the
         reader-response documents. Having machine-readable documents and the annotations on
         sentence level in a structured text format would be incredibly helpful for follow-up
         research within computational literary studies.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the case studies of chapters five, six, seven, and nine, the initial hypothesis
         is differentiated into more specific sub-hypotheses which are assessed based on classical
         non-Bayesian statistics. These hypotheses, which are performed on each text type and
         genre claim that text-to-world-references are more or less likely to occur in historical
         reader response depending on genre expectations. Hence, Gittel examines the difference
         between reviews that assign a novel to a specific sub-genre and reviews that are neutral
         to sub-genre assignments. In the next step, he introduces a further distinction between
         text type and genre effects. Text type effects point at text-to-world references that
         are characteristic to all historical novels independently of the genre assignments
         of historical reviewers. Genre effects, in contrast, refer to the differences in the
         levels of text-to-world references by reviewers depending on the sub-genre assignments
         the reviewers are committed to.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">From an overall perspective, the book succeeds in providing new and substantial insights
         as it detects specific footprints for each text type as well as genre effects within
         each text type. The footprints for the distribution of object reference, exemplification,
         truth, and isomorphism are cumulated in Fig. 47 (p. 308) and related to common hypotheses
         on fictionality and poetic realism in the synthesizing chapter eight. In the case
         studies on each text type, genre-specific effects are also verified. If, for instance,
         a work of fiction is perceived as a historical novel, Gittel shows that object references
         are more likely to be observed compared to a genre-neutral perception. Moreover, each
         genre has its most relevant reference type: For the <span style="font-style:italic">Tendenzroman</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">roman à these</span>) it is the implicit and explicit truths, whereas isomorphism is dominant in the genre
         expectations of the <span style="font-style:italic">Zeitroman</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">I shall return to the philological significance of these results at the end of this
         book review after discussing several methodological constraints that are in parts
         discussed by Gittel. Aside from some very hypothetical and artificial objections,
         two concerns are of more practical relevance. The main line of argument of the book
         implies an unambiguous causal relation between genre assignments and text-to-world
         references. According to a claim that has already been made by Walton in his seminal
         paper on “Categories of Art” (1970), perceiving a work of art within a category implies
         that readers expect specific features to be present in the work and base their aesthetic
         appreciation on either recognizing or not recognizing these features. Hence, the causal
         relation is expected to originate from genre expectation to the perception of features.
         However, both directions of causality are possible in principle. As Gittel points
         out, the inverse direction would be that of classifying a work as an instance of a
         genre based on previously observed features. Accordingly, Gittel models the assumed
         causal direction from expectation to perception within the frameworks of a causal
         theory of action and inference to the best explanation. However, Gittel considers
         the actual direction of causality to be eventually unverifiable based on quantitative
         analysis. Here, he brings the sequential mixed methods design into play. Looking at
         the reviews from a qualitative perspective is the only solution Gittel considers for
         verifying causality. The issue of causality is, however, and as far as I see, not
         consistently addressed in the subsequent qualitative sections.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Irrespective of the old belief that empirical analysis can only show correlation but
         not causality itself, I believe that there are options to model hypotheses on the
         causal relation also in
         <!--
                       p. -->quantitative research designs. I believe that this would have required a different
         strategy of data collection. If we knew reader responses based on genre assignments
         that were provided prior to the reader responses themselves (based, for example, on
         the genre assignments from paratext labels, which are excluded for good reason in
         Gittel’s design), it would be possible to look at the likelihood for both possible
         causal relations in more detail. As the book does not consider such a strategy, future
         work should add one further quantitative step to the sequential explanatory design
         in order to solve this issue.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The second objection that Gittel anticipates concerns type effects and the construction
         of the corpus in general. One may be surprised that Gittel claims to observe text-type
         effects although he only considers actual reader responses instead of the texts. However,
         there are two prior assumptions allowing him to raise his claim: Firstly, that the
         reviews are related to novels of one common text type, respectively. I shall not question
         this assumption here for the genres and text types considered in the case studies.
         Secondly, the case studies presume that readers’ responses are rational, by and large.
         Based on both assumptions, inferences from reader response to text type can in principle
         be assessed by subtracting genre effects. However, Gittel only considers genres that
         include the expectation of higher-than-average text-to-world-references. This makes
         it more than difficult to infer on average text-to-world-references for fiction independently
         of sub-genre assignments. As Gittel concedes, it would have been helpful to also take
         into consideration genres that could have less-than-average text-to-world references.
         For a methodologically rigorous and hypothesis-driven case study, it could be objected
         that text type effects are not operationalized in the best possible way in this study.
         This brings me back to the initial question and hence to the assessment of the overall
         style of reasoning of a book that includes different fields and research areas.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">A particular challenge that Gittel’s monograph faces is to reconcile two contrary
         requirements, that of providing a comprehensive historical outline of genre practices
         on the one hand and that of justifying empirical findings with statistical scrutiny
         on the other hand. It is a remarkable achievement of <span style="font-style:italic">Fiktion und Genre</span> that the demand for a holistic historical account leads to only very few empirical
         inaccuracies and that most of these inaccuracies are made transparent. The book provides
         a courageous step towards a fine-grained and stepwise development without losing sight
         of the overall argument.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">I shall finally address one possible objection that Gittel does not anticipate. Concerning
         the empirical results, I can imagine that some literary historians might find the
         above-mentioned footprints including the text type and genre-specific text-to-world
         distributions of references hardly surprising as far as these footprints confirm previous
         knowledge. This would, at least, be an objection that scholars working on quantitative
         methods regularly face. I want to emphasize that this objection would be inappropriate
         to Gittel’s findings. While the general text-type footprints indeed confirm previous
         knowledge, the confirmation based on new evidence is valuable in itself. Furthermore,
         the subtle differences in the level of genre expectations between genres, as well
         as between genres and text types, are highly interesting and need further interpretation.
         In this context, Gittel’s classical statistical approach could be complemented not
         only by more extensive hermeneutic and qualitative analysis but also quantitatively
         by algorithmic models accounting for the relative tendencies and changes. In other
         words, future research could use numbers not only to explore corpora and to perform
         statistical hypothesis testing but also to describe the subtle historical changes
         in genre semantics.

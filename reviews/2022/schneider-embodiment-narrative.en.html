      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The acknowledgment that human cognition is shaped by, and thus indissolubly linked
         with, lived bodily experience in spatial and social surroundings – embodiment, for
         short – has given rise to an approach that ranks among the most successful ones in
         the recent development of literary theories, beside some others, such as Queer Theory
         and Ecocriticism. The study of the role of embodied cognition in literature, and narrative
         in particular, links up easily with (neo)phenomenological conceptions of the experiential
         qualities of human thought, feeling, and action; furthermore, its underpinnings in
         the broad and multi-disciplinary field of the Cognitive Sciences connects it with
         a range of current linguistic, psychological, and philosophical research interests
         in the humanities. Approaches to literature based on theories of embodiment should
         therefore meet with broad acceptance and approval. The field, however, also has the
         power to polarize: since it offers some very fundamental new insights into the human
         mind, it is likely to shake some of the foundations of existing theories; at the same
         time, to what extent the practice of literary analysis and interpretation, as well
         as the study of reader response, will be revolutionized on a large scale by the concept
         of embodiment remains to be seen.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The volume under review, co-written by two of the most prolific contributors to contemporary
         Cognitive Literary Studies and most ardent advocates of embodiment theories, links
         the study of embodied cognition (or, »4E cognition«, see below) to central questions
         of (cognitive) narratology and reader response. It comes at a point in time when,
         on the one hand, embodiment is on everybody's lips, but on the other, many literary
         scholars still wonder how precisely embodiment will add to, modify or in some other
         way affect their own work. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that this book proposes
         some basic re-conceptualizations of notions prominent in classical and post-classical
         narratology and reader-oriented literary scholarship, while at the same time highlighting
         some of the open questions and problems that current cognitive (and, by extension,
         empirical) literary scholarship is riddled with. In the combination of these two aspects,
         the book is an extremely valuable contribution to an ongoing discussion, and the (rather
         unwieldy) title in fact encapsulates both: Yes, we read – always and necessarily –
         <span style="font-style:italic">with</span> our <span style="font-style:italic">bodies</span>, i.e., on the basis of our cognitive dispositions, which are formed under the impact
         of our embodied experiences in the world, and the bodily aspects of narrative storyworlds
         need to be taken seriously; but to what extent our reading is predominantly or even
         exclusively shaped by embodied cognition, is still far from clear.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The authors set out to provide a whole range of answers to such questions, and they
         do so by referring to '4E cognition' as their theoretical basis. It has become common
         parlance in the cognitive sciences and beyond to address the relevance of bodily experience
         for the development and use of the mind's conceptual apparatus under that summary
         label. The term '4E cognition' has emerged almost as a shorthand for approaches that
         reject both the fundamental 'Cartesian split' between the mind and the body, and all
         approaches to the human mind that considered it a program that can run independently
         of its physical entrenchment, as 'first-gen
         <!--
                       p. -->eration' cognitive science with its conceptualization of the mind in terms of a computer
         is frequently blamed for doing.<span id="Note1_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. Albert Newen/Leon de Bruin/Shaun Gallagher (eds.), 4E Cognition: Historical Roots, Key Concepts, and Central Issues. In: Newen/de Bruin/Gallagher…" href="#Note1">[1]</a></span> The mind, according to the 4E label that represents the 'second generation' in cognitive
         science, is embodied, embedded, enactive and extended: »embodied« here means that
         the mind springs from the body's state as a biological organism that is in contact
         with its surroundings, linked to other human beings, involved in cultural practices
         and the locus of every single experience a human being is capable of; it is »embedded«
         by being always tied to its particular surroundings, and »enactive« in so far as the
         interactions between the mind and its surroundings need to be taken seriously (rather
         than considering the mind a passive recipient and processor of external stimuli).
         Finally, the mind can be called »extended« because the way it works is also shaped
         by the artifacts and technologies with which humans interact (cf. 5-6). Apart from
         the fact that there is some overlap between these areas, there are hints that within
         the Cognitive Sciences there is much less unanimity than the single label suggests,
         and that proponents of, say, extended cognition do not necessarily share much research
         interest, let alone methodology, with representatives of enactive conceptions of the
         mind.<span id="Note2_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="For such criticism, see, for instance, Richard Menary, Introduction to the Special Issue on 4E Cognition, Phenomenology and The Cognitive Sciences 9:…" href="#Note2">[2]</a></span> Although the authors are fully aware of this problem, they have decided that »the
         shared emphasis on the body« and the »primacy of embodiment« that characterizes scholarship
         on all of the four 'E's provides enough common ground to continue using it (6, footnote
         5). This gives rise to my first question: Would it not be more accurate and helpful
         to acknowledge that some of the ›E‹s may be more relevant to the study of literature
         and its effect on readers than others, and that the effects of the individual ›E‹s
         may prove to be quite different? Extended cognition, for instance, does not really
         feature much in the book under review, while the embodied and enactive aspects are
         predominant, and embedded cognition comes into play only here and there (in particular
         in references to Laurence Barsalou’s notion of situated conceptualizations; see chapters
         7 and 9). It appears that with embodiment, as elsewhere, when concepts travel from
         one discipline to another, differentiations of relevance in the field of origin are
         sometimes lost.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The book consists of two parts, part I being titled »The Embodied Dynamics of Storyworlds«
         and part II »The Embodied Dynamics of Time and Plot«. As these titles emphasize, literary
         reading and its effects are conceived as dynamic experiences unfolding throughout
         reading, which links the study to the tradition of such reader response theories from
         Stanley Fish to Wolfgang Iser and beyond, with their focus on the active role of the
         reader’s mind in meaning construction, and their emphasis on the processual, dynamic
         aspects of reading, that have provided some of the foundations for contemporary Cognitive
         Literary Studies. Theories of 4E cognition, on the one hand make an even stronger
         claim for the dynamic and active role of the reader, since meaning is massively shaped
         by the bodily, emotional, social, and cultural experiences a particular mind brings
         to and employs during reading. On the other hand, as the book under review suggests,
         texts have considerable power triggering responses in readers, because readers will
         react with the (unconscious) activation of sensorimotor neural patterns and traces
         of lived experience when encountering words that resonate with such patterns and traces.

      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Chapter 1 engages with the experience of what is metaphorically called »immersion«,
         »transportation«, and »presence«, i.e., the reader’s impression of being somehow ›inside‹
         the storyworld. The authors plausibly argue that the series of situation models readers
         continually construct and modify during reading can feel »thick«, or »fleshed out«
         to them if the textual descriptions trigger traces of embodied, real-world experience.
         It is a problem inherent in the description of mental activities that one set of metaphors
         (»immersion«, »transportation«) that, due to the fuzziness of metaphors, may contain
         aspects unrelated to the phenomenon (see 41) can only be exchanged for another set
         of metaphors (»to thicken«, »to flesh out«). It is to be hoped that at some point
         we can exchange the metaphors for more precise process models of the cognitive and
         emotional operations of the mind that occur during the experiences addressed in the
         book. Chapter 2 looks at the way that authors, narrators, and characters may emerge
         as embodied entities in the reader’s mind by degrees, in opposition to the usually
         hard-and-fast
         <!--
                       p. -->narratological categorizations of different types of narrators and characters, as
         well as the ontological divide between authors and the text-internal agencies of communication.
         Chapter 3 maintains that »characters’ bodies play a key role both in how internal
         focalization is textually implemented and in guiding readers' responses to the text
         as a whole« (67), since many of a characters’ perceptions rendered in passages of
         focalization trigger the reader's own bodily experience of the world, contributing
         to the thickening of his or her situation model. Here and elsewhere in the book, the
         examples from literary texts are wisely chosen, because in them, bodily experience
         is invariably foregrounded. The protagonist’s experience in Julio Cortázar’s short
         story »The Night Face Up« (»La noche boca arriba«), for instance, is so densely sensory
         that even theorists unconcerned with embodied cognition are certain to acknowledge
         that as a central feature of the text. While the authors cannot be blamed for selecting
         texts that support their argument about the centrality of embodiment, the present
         reviewer wondered what else occurs in literary reading that might <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> be exclusively or predominantly informed by embodiment, since not all, and perhaps
         not even the majority, of passages in prose fiction foreground the corporeal presence
         of the characters or the impressions of their senses. What are readers’ situation
         models like if the experience rendered through internal focalization happens to focus
         on something else than bodily experience? What if the character ponders, e.g., about
         the relationship between other characters, as Lily Briscoe frequently does in Virginia
         Woolf’s <span style="font-style:italic">To the Lighthouse</span> (one of the texts used as an example in <span style="font-style:italic">With Bodies</span>)? It stands to reason that a reader in the habit of thinking about other people’s
         relationships will be able to construct a »thick« situation model that does not, however,
         focus on some sort of embodied experience, but is rather »fleshed out« by their experience
         and skills in social cognition. Proponents of embodiment theory might argue that even
         Lily Briscoe’s and the reader’s social cognition skills are ultimately based in bodily
         experience; while I agree here in principle, I wonder whether the embodied basis is
         what makes the reading of Lily’s ponderings personally meaningful? Although our bodies
         are always there, and the basis for all cognition, mental processes can and will also
         entail thought processes that do not evoke embodied experience and may well appear
         ›bodiless‹ to the reader. The main question here – and the one that may be most difficult
         to answer – is which kinds of embodiment are conscious, whether embodied response
         exists on either side of a consciousness-threshold, what it takes for that threshold
         to be crossed, and how that would change readers’ response to a text. The authors
         refer to many of the processes they describe as being unconscious over the chapters
         of the book, but a more systematic account of conscious and unconscious embodiment
         effects is called for. I would argue that mental processes which focus on other issues
         than embodiment, even if they involve the body on a basic and unconscious level, should
         not disappear from view if we do not want to end up with only a partial and particular
         understanding of the affordances of literary reading. A strong point of the third
         chapter is that the authors go on to criticize the notion of mental imagery, which
         has too often been misunderstood as imitating film-like visual representation; rather,
         Caracciolo and Kukkonen argue, following philosophers like Alva Noë, it is the multimodal
         sensorimotor traces of lived experience that add to readers’ thickening of situation
         models. Another important discussion follows in the section on empathy (74-79), which
         deals with the notoriously difficult and fuzzy concepts of empathy and sympathy. The
         authors convincingly propose a differentiated conception of empathy as comprising
         such diverse aspects as perceptual, somatic, emotional, epistemic, and axiological
         facets or readers' impression of being close to characters (76), and they point out
         that it depends on both the individual reader's dispositions and the textual signals
         whether, and to what extent, those different facets of empathy materialize. In connection
         with my suggestion to keep the less embodied aspects of the reading experience in
         mind, such a differentiated model of empathy would certainly enrich our understanding
         of different ways of readers cognitive-emotional engagement, even if the authors (unsurprisingly)
         place most emphasis on the somatic and perceptual aspects. Chapter 4 considers how
         the experience of fictional spaces is shaped by the structural analogies between them
         and the real-world spaces
         <!--
                       p. -->readers have experienced. It is especially when spatial descriptions entail an affective
         dimension that the imagination of a fictional space gains relevance and, again, thickness:
         »readers’ engagement with narrative space is driven by emotion, not by the need for
         pictorial completeness or even coherence« (93) That affective dimension also informs
         and structures the immediate experience of a narrative: »As readers experience an
         atmosphere, or feelings of immersion in a story, they are already interpreting it
         in affective terms.« (96)
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The second part of the book opens with chapter 5, which focuses on the processual
         dynamics of narrative understanding and engagement, in particular on the fact that
         readers do not simply process information on story and plot as delivered by the text,
         but rather establish a scaffold of predictions that interact with the unfolding events.
         Chapter 6 looks at narrative action which Caracciolo and Kukkonen also regard as »deeply
         and fundamentally embodied« (123) through the characters, because the description
         of their physical actions can trigger motor resonances in the reader, and the emotional
         valence of their actions is apt to generate expectations as to the development of
         whole action sequences. Again, some caution is due with regard to the text’s power:
         since no single word, sentence or passage can coerce the reader into performing any
         kind of cognitive-emotional reaction, the question whether descriptions of actions
         trigger sensorimotor experiential traces in all readers, and if not, under which conditions
         they do and under which they do not can only be answered by more empirical research,
         and on the basis of more elaborate theorizing. Of particular interest in this chapter
         (admittedly because it overlaps with this reviewer's current preoccupations) is the
         section on image schemas, i.e., the result of very basic spatio-temporal encounters
         of the body with the forces of its environment that according to Mark Johnson and
         others fundamentally shape our conceptual apparatus.<span id="Note3_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="See Mark Johnson, The Body in the Mind, Chicago 1987; Beate Hampe (ed.), From Perception to Meaning: Image Schemas in Cognitive Linguistics, Berlin 2…" href="#Note3">[3]</a></span> Such image schemas as <span style="font-variant: small-caps">path</span>, <span style="font-variant: small-caps">counterforce</span>, or <span style="font-variant: small-caps">blockage</span>, as Caracciolo and Kukkonen plausibly argue, play a role in the reader's (unconscious)
         understanding the general »drift« of the plot and its emotional valence, and they
         entail a dynamics of prediction that structures the reading. Chapter 7, on »Plot,
         Abstraction, and Situated Conceptualization«, is the least convincing one in making
         a point for the relevance of embodiment. Although the authors concede that the concept
         of plot »seems difficult to reconcile with an embodied approach to narrative« (145),
         they propose to use Barsalou's »situated conceptualizations« to do precisely that.
         According to Barsalou, when we learn abstract concepts, the traces of the concrete
         situation in which we have encountered the examples of a concept are activated in
         the brain.<span id="Note4_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="See, e.g., Laurence Barsalou, Situated Simulation in the Human Conceptual System, Language and Cognitive Processes 18:5-6 (2003), 513–562 and Situate…" href="#Note4">[4]</a></span> However, the authors’ arguments that »[a] literary narrative can arguably build up
         its own ›situated conceptualizations‹ through patterns in its embodied language« and
         that »[p]lot […] comes from the situated conceptualizations developed in tandem with
         embodied resonances« (145 and 147, respectively) strike me as rather laboured. Wouldn’t
         this be a case in which it makes sense to give those mental operations their due whose
         embodied aspects may turn out to be less relevant than their non-embodied ones, i.e.,
         mental operations that, in spite of their necessary grounding in concrete bodily experience,
         involve other and more dominant constituents of meaning for the reader than bodily
         ones? With a universalist claim such as the claim that embodiment is at the root of
         literally all human thinking, feeling, and action, the literary theorist is bound
         to search for and claim the importance of the embodied aspects of all issues to do
         with literature. For theory-building, this does not appear to be a wise move. Not
         everything the first generation of cognitive approaches suggested about text understanding
         and the role of knowledge was utterly wrong, after all, in spite of an undue dissociation
         of mind and body, and the authors also use concepts like frames and schemata, core
         concepts in first-generation cognitive theory that are established concepts for the
         description of human cognition. An integration of first-generation insights on the
         one hand, and second-generation shifts in emphasis and re-conceptions on the other
         might salvage what ca. three decades of research have achieved in the way of understanding
         the complex interrelatedness between the mind and (narrative) text, without understating
         the role of embodiment. Chapter 8 returns to authors and narrators, this time with
         a focus on
         <!--
                       p. -->the dynamics of joint attention, which is an instrument of temporal control employed
         by authors and narrators to influence narrative speed and viewpoint changes. In that
         chapter, Caracciolo and Kukkonen also point to the fact that the reading of a book,
         in particular a printed one, involves the reader’s body on an additional level. Future
         research is likely to continue exploring the differences in embodied response to narrative
         presented in different media, such as e-readers or as audiobooks.<span id="Note5_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="For promising work in this field, see for instance studies by Anne Mangen and collaborators: Anne Mangen/Don Kuiken, Lost in the iPad: Narrative Enga…" href="#Note5">[5]</a></span> The final chapter then presents thumbnail sketches of more potential applications
         of an ›embodied narratology‹ to narratives that focus on a range of themes. These
         readings, which are given a bit more space than the necessarily brief discussions
         of sample texts in the preceding chapters, demonstrate that there are a culturally
         specific and hence varying ways in which embodiment informs the meaning of narrative.
         This is an important addition, since embodiment is a concept that comes with quite
         a strong universalist claim. Literary and cultural scholars will always be interested
         in the ways that universal human abilities and dispositions interact with their particular
         surroundings.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In conclusion, the book under review is a most welcome contribution to an ongoing
         debate. It makes a number of important suggestions about the role of embodied cognition
         in narrative, and it reminds us that there are still some open questions concerning
         the exact kind and intensity of embodiment effects in narrative reading. Although
         without doubt <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> thinking results, at some level, from the mind’s situatedness in a body in an environment,
         the concept of embodiment risks losing its power of making a substantial contribution
         to our understanding of how literature works if it is not spelled out in more detail
         when, under which conditions, and in reaction to which textual features readers actually
         mentally perform the cues to a heavily embodied mode of reception, whether this occurs
         consciously or unconsciously, and in which ways interpretations of literary texts
         can be enriched by the acknowledgment of embodiment. This also entails the question
         whether there are different reader types with regard to their ability or willingness
         to engage in embodied reading experiences. Throughout the book, Caracciolo and Kukkonen
         state that many of theoretical constructions they propose are precisely that: theoretical
         and personal, i.e., they are based on the authors’ own reading experience, not on
         empirical findings that could corroborate or falsify the assumptions. The proliferation
         of the word »arguably« (and comparable formulations) in the volume testifies to the
         caution with which Caracciolo and Kukkonen approach their suggestions. This is not
         a problem in itself – other approaches to literature are no less speculative when
         it comes to assumptions about reader response, either. However, in spite of their
         frequent use of cautious formulations, the authors also make quite a number of very
         strong claims about how the reader reacts to embodiment cues, as for instance in the
         opening passage: »By the end of the passage, Calvino has his readers upside down,
         imagining themselves in a yoga position.« (2). Although the consequence seems to be
         a plea for extensive empirical testing of such claims, a fundamental problem stands
         in the way as yet: as we have seen a number of times, and as the authors also repeatedly
         remark, many of the processes dealt with in this book occur below the threshold of
         consciousness. How to generate data on unconscious processes without either disturbing
         them while they occur, or biasing respondents towards constructing a certain intended
         outcome when enquiring after them retrospectively, is a massive challenge for empirical
         literary studies. It seems plausible to look for mixed-method approaches, and combinations
         of qualitative and quantitative strategies of data elicitation. To get at operationalizable
         hypotheses that are fine-grained enough for the further empirical testing, the theory
         of embodied cognition in narrative understanding could profit from more detailed process
         models based on both phenomenological approaches to meaning constitution and cognitive-linguistic
         conceptions of the impact of textual features, as in, say, cognitive grammar or text-world
         theory, to name only two relevant candidates for a more intensive dialogue with theorization

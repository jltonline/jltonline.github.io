      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Maybe the cover image tells us more about the <span style="font-style:italic">Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Literary Studies</span> than intended. Georges de la Tour’s <span style="font-style:italic">Le Tricheur à l’as de carreau</span> is a painting in the wake of Caravaggio showing the three major temptations according
         to 17<sup>th</sup> century moral standards: gambling, wine, and lust. If one assumes that literature
         is a kind of gambling, cheating, and a dangerous lust in itself, the choice of cover
         makes sense. If not, then it’s more or less a stopgap solution. It is not (yet) an
         independent area of research like cognitive linguistics has become. Besides that,
         the term ›cognitive‹ is in literary criticism often only loosely used and one might
         think cognitive literary studies are just the current next turn in criticism. How
         could one find an image representing such a blurred area? It seems to be difficult
         even for a publishing house like Oxford University Press. The problem of the cover
         image is maybe only of anecdotal interest. However, the stopgap solution of the cover
         image points to the question, whether cognitive literary studies are already an area
         a handbook could encompass? After taking a closer look at the <span style="font-style:italic">Oxford Handbook</span>, the short answer is: Cognitive literary studies is still not an area in its own
         right, rather the <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span> presents a vivid and inspiring field of diverse and often tentative approaches, which
         share some common notions, practices, and concepts, one could summarise as ›cognitive‹.
         With this I have jumped a long way ahead. Let’s start from the beginning.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1" lang="de" translate="no">I.</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Zchn">With the publication of the <span style="font-style:italic">Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Literary Studies</span> the field of cognitive literary studies seems to have crossed the threshold and is
            made to appear as an independent area. The <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span> is definitely not the only publications in recent years mapping the field as a more
            or less autonomous area in the wide sea of literary studies. Stockwell’s <span style="font-style:italic">Cognitive Poetics</span> (2002) together with Gavins’s and Steen’s <span style="font-style:italic">Cognitive Poetics in Practice</span> (2003), Semino’s and Culpeper’s <span style="font-style:italic">Cognitive Stylistics</span> (2002), Bortolussi’s and Dixon’s <span style="font-style:italic">Psychonarratology</span> (2003), Hogan’s <span style="font-style:italic">Cognitive Science, Literature, and the Arts</span> (2003), Richardson’s and Spolsky’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Work of Fiction</span> (2004), Miall’s <span style="font-style:italic">Literary Meaning</span> (2006), <span style="font-style:italic">Turner’s The Artful Mind</span> (2006), Auracher’s and van Peer’s <span style="font-style:italic">New Beginnings in Literary Studies</span> (2008), Vandaele’s and Brône’s <span style="font-style:italic">Cognitive Poetics</span> (2009), Leverage’s et al. <span style="font-style:italic">Theory of Mind and Literature</span> (2010), Zunshine’s own <span style="font-style:italic">Introduction to Cognitive Cultural Studies</span> (2010), Herman’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Emergence of Mind</span> (2011), Oatley’s <span style="font-style:italic">Such Stuff like Dreams</span> (2011), Jaén’s and Simon’s <span style="font-style:italic">Cognitive Literary Studies</span> (2012), Sanford’s and Emmott’s <span style="font-style:italic">Mind, Brain and Narrative</span> (2012), Bruhn’s and Wehrs’s <span style="font-style:italic">Cogni</span><span style="font-style:italic">tion, Literature, and History</span> (2013), Bernaerts’s et al. <span style="font-style:italic">Stories and Minds</span> (2013), Wege’s <span style="font-style:italic">Theorie</span><span style="font-style:italic"> und Praxis der </span><span style="font-style:italic">Kognitiven</span> <span style="font-style:italic">Literaturwissenschaft</span> (2013), are all recently published books, which try to offer a kind of a chart of
            what the land of cognitive</span>literary studies looks like. At least with regard to volume and variety of perspectives
         the <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook </span>is currently the most advanced encyclopaedic attempt to cover the field.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Most of the handbook’s authors belong to the so called second generation of cognitive
         literary scholars like the main editor Lisa Zunshine herself.<span id="Note1_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. H. Porter Abbott, Cognitive Literary Studies: The »Second Generation«, Poetics Today 27:4 (2006), 711–722." href="#Note1">[1]</a></span> While the first generation in the 80s and 
         <!--
                       p. -->90s came from a linguistic perspective based in the tradition of Russian Formalism
         and Structuralism, the second generation today looks from the perspective of literary
         studies, narratology or cultural studies. In this sense cognitive literary study is
         not simply the continuation of cognitive poetics. The difference between cognitive
         poetics and cognitive literary studies is significant and warrants caution before
         putting both under the same broad umbrella term. The main object in cognitive poetics
         was poetry and the methods used are close readings informed by findings of linguistics
         and the cognitive neurosciences. A shared methodology is what has formed cognitive
         poetics over more than two decades. In cognitive literary studies on the other hand,
         novels are the main object of research and a common methodology is no longer shared.
         The difference is clearly named by <span style="font-weight:bold">Zunshine</span> in the introduction to the <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span>, when she writes about »resistance to unified theories« (2). In line with Ellen Spolsky’s
         thesis about cognitive literary theory as a post-structuralist variant she stated
         that mind, brain, and literature are so complex and rich, no theory, no method and
         no methodology could capture their complexity.<span id="Note2_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. Ellen Spolsky, Darwin and Derrida: Cognitive Literary Theory as a Species of Post-structuralism, Poetics Today 23:1 (2002), 43–62." href="#Note2">[2]</a></span> Hence, criticism and not science should be the way of cognitive literary studies
         and only a broad variety of paradigms and approaches is appropriate. Cognitive literary
         criticism is, although not used, but the term more precise than ›studies‹, according
         to the editor. This is by no means a convincing argument. Cognitive poetics would
         argue the opposite: Because the studied object is so tricky, a controlled methodology
         is necessary. However, in the end the <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span> does not encourage a reissue of an ›anything goes‹ approach to literary studies and
         is not as much anti-science, as one might expect. Post-structuralism is at best a
         light memory. The majority of contributions draw quite natural insights from cognitive
         science to sharpen their arguments and to strengthen the basic assumptions of how
         literature works. Sciences are a framework nobody really questions. There is a second
         group of articles which is closer to cognitive poetics and uses detailed cognitive
         linguistic or narratological insights to analyse literature. And there is a third,
         but small group, which runs experiments the way cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists
         do.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">According to the <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span> cognitive literary studies are divided in five parts. The first part is the largest
         and includes historical and narratological approaches, cultural theory (here Queer
         Theory) and neuroaesthetics. The second part looks at the affective side of literature,
         film and theatre, also includes postcolonial studies, decision theory, disability
         studies and moral emotions. A small part three is dedicated to the concept of the
         new unconscious. Empirical studies of literature make up the fourth part and the last
         part deals with cognitive theory as a tool to understand literature. Like the cover
         image the categories used for the <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span> show an additive collection of approaches and not an already structured and coherent
         discipline. To give but one example: Only for a small group of scholars in the field
         the concept of the new unconscious is of greater importance to be a separate chapter.
         In this sense the <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span> represents the mixed state of art, - with some shortcomings, to which I will come
         back later.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Mary Thomas Crane </span>uses insights from cognitive linguistics into how humans categorise the world based
         on bodily and cultural experience to understand 17th century writings. By showing
         how texts like Spencer’s <span style="font-style:italic">Faerie Queene</span> are informed by identifiable cognitive paradigms, she investigates the epistemological
         rupture when early modern English literary works lose track with commonly held intuitive
         knowledge. Historical criticism and cognitive approaches illuminate each other, without
         using literature as just an illustration for a theoretical point made by cognitive
         science.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Ellen Spolsky</span> explores why art matters for (historical) societies when she looks at how the cognitive
         model of learning could be used to understand historical change. Literature signals
         risk or impending social instability like in 16<sup>th</sup>, and 17<sup>th</sup> century plays and pleads for changes in the judicial system. In Spolsky’s historical
         approach the cognitive insights about embodied processes that manage complex states
         of disorganization are homologous to works of art, which 
         <!--
                       p. -->help to overcome habitual ways of thinking. Here cognitive and literary studies make
         each other up.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">While Crane and Spolsky used cognitive insights for a kind of background check, <span style="font-weight:bold">Natalie M. Phillips</span> ran an fMRI experiment to explore the cognitive differences between two modes of
         literary attention: Pleasure reading and close reading. Her example was a chapter
         of Austen’s novel <span style="font-style:italic">Mansfield Park</span> and her data suggests that close reading activates almost all brain regions which
         pleasure reading does not. Each mode of reading has a distinct neural signature. Phillips
         calls here approach ›literary neurosciences‹, an interdisciplinary collaboration within
         neuroscience. It is apparent how much such a scientific approach contrasts with many
         other articles in the same handbook.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Peter Rabinowitz</span> expands his distinction between those readers who will actually read a text and those
         the author has in mind while composing the text, with the distinction between mind-writer
         and mind-reader. It is the exchange between the mind reading of the author and the
         mind reading of the reader which brings stories alive. Proust’s <span style="font-style:italic">In Search of Lost Time</span> is his example for his careful narratological analysis along the features of how
         writer and reader share emotions in the story, how complex the embedded act of mind-reading
         is, whether mind-readers and mind-writers switch positions or not, how many people
         are involved in story sharing, from what angle a story is exchanged, how transparent
         characters and events between writer and reader are, what kind of modal variant like
         fictionality complicates the cognitive exchange and how consistent characters react
         to other characters. His classification is in sum more narratological than cognitive.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the reading of fiction and even nonfiction possible narrative threads often pop
         up, simply because there is always more to tell than told. <span style="font-weight:bold">H. Porter Abbott</span> takes care of these, what he calls ›shadow stories‹, the incalculable epiphenomena
         of any reader’s experience. What happens, when neither explicit nor implicit evidence
         in a text is given about certain characters and events? Abbott examines different
         examples to understand the narrative activity of the reader’s mind, which starts before
         interpretation and gives readers a sense of knowing. For Abbott narratology illuminates
         cognitive processes.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Rhetoric and narratology have a lot in common.<span style="font-weight:bold">James Phelan </span>discusses how both approaches deploy general cognitive mechanisms. Using the example
         of Toni Morrison <span style="font-style:italic">Recitatif</span> Phelan offers a careful interpretation neither rhetorical theory nor cognitive theory
         could offer alone. The ›cognitive‹ is taken as the bridge between the two approaches.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Alan Palmer</span> analyses country song lyrics as narratives. As Palmer can show, the lyrics can only
         be understood by following the mental functioning of the singer/narrator. Song lyrics
         following the tradition of ballads invite the hearer to focus on the inner cognitive
         world of the singer and his or her themes such as aging, work, class, identity, love,
         friendship and place. To ascribe states of mind to others, singer and hearer have
         to share a common ground, a similar but not identical understanding of the social
         contexts inside which country music is written, recorded and performed. ›Cognitive‹
         here means mainly the ability of mind-reading.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Blending, a cognitive concept developed by Mark Turner and Gilles Fauconnier, as a
         functional joining of two mental spaces that create new meaning, is an underlying
         mechanism for humour also used in cartoons. <span style="font-weight:bold">Monika Fludernik</span> explores the concept of blending to discuss how humour is generated by blending at
         least two incongruous scenarios in one cartoon to elicit an implied narrative. But
         cartoons do not rely on the overlap or blending of incompatible scenarios – instead
         they rely on the clash between them, as Fludernik shows. She takes cartoons as a useful
         example to discuss the interplay of blending, humour, and narrative.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->Fiction can represent mental states without explicitly referring to them. However,
         the issue is more complex. Stories often include, what <span style="font-weight:bold">Lisa Zunshine’s</span> contribution to her <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span> called ›nested mental states‹ – like we have even in many complementary phrases,
         e.g. »She thinks, he wants her to feel etc.« Fiction, as Zunshine points out, makes
         heavy use of nested mental states. Her example, Cao Xueqin’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Story of the Stone</span>, is a perfect case study of how fictional narratives enrich readers’ ability to understand
         others by their complex, nested processes of mentalizing. Indeed this is an argument
         for the use of good stories in schools.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Like many literary theories queer theory is commonly kin to psychoanalysis but not
         to cognitive concepts. <span style="font-weight:bold">J. Keith Vincent</span>, though, developed a dialogue between queer theory and cognitive theory. He proposes
         that the cognitive approach is helpful to overcome the inside/out distinction because
         cognitive theory teaches us to understand how we make sense of others’ minds. To understand
         one’s mind we have to understand the mind of many people. Literature – like in Vincent’s
         case <span style="font-style:italic">The Tale of Genji</span> – makes use of a complex layering of minds distributed to different characters and
         the narrator, a narrative technique to show the deindividualisation of desire which
         is the grammar of desire queer theory is mainly interested in.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Mind reading is the aspect most papers of the <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook </span>are interested in when talking of cognitive approaches and cognitive theory. Forming
         mental images while reading by recruiting more than one imagined sense at a time is
         explained by a variety of current cognitive theories <span style="font-weight:bold">Alan Richardson</span> has done a critical evaluation on. His paper shows how conceptual metaphor, blending
         theory and the default mode network open up literary theoretical interest in imagination.
         As Richardson points out an active collaboration among literary and cognitive research
         promises to be of mutual benefit.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">A fruitful collaboration between neuroscience and literary studies is presented by
         <span style="font-weight:bold">G. Gabrielle Starr</span>. Her fMRI experiment on the default mode network explores what kind of rewards the
         production of mental images carries. Her research suggests that the interplay between
         one’s internal representation of the self and the external world given by an art work
         is pleasurable. She speculates and offers first empirical evidence whether the combination
         of emotional and reward engagement and the production of imagery by recall interact
         with the default mode network in the brain to promote aesthetic pleasure.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Patrick Colm Hogan’s</span> paper thoughtfully scrutinises what literature teaches us about emotion. To do so
         he takes into account experimental and theoretical findings by Keith Oatley on how
         literature might train our spontaneous emotional response, by Martha Nussbaum and
         her thesis about emotional reasoning, and by Semir Zeki’s theory of pleasure elucidated
         by ambiguity in art. Additionally Hogan’s interpretation of Mirabai’s love lyrics
         makes use of these cognitive theories to understand the poems and, at the same time,
         our emotional lives.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The pivotal role of faces for movies is the topic for <span style="font-weight:bold">Carl Plantinga’s</span> contribution. With the example of <span style="font-style:italic">The Silence of the Lambs </span>Plantinga analyses viewer’s experience of facial close-ups and points to the benefits
         of a cognitive approach, i.e. psychological and biological knowledge, particular to
         the study of the human face as represented in narrative film.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Noël Carroll</span> illuminates the aesthetic and cognitive techniques theatre uses to influence the
         feelings of spectators. He criticises the idea that identification and empathy with
         the character are the major triggers of emotion for the audience. Instead he reveals
         how unlikely the character’s emotions and the spectator’s emotions are identical and
         demonstrates how they differ. The critical prefocusing of viewers and not identification
         with the character is of paramount importance for the feelings theatres provoke.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->In his second contribution <span style="font-weight:bold">Patrick Colm Hogan</span> considers several approaches offered by cognitive theory to understand the psychological
         relation between the colonizer and the colonized. What he calls »cognitive postcolonialism«
         (343) offers a better grounded account of identity, which clarifies many insights
         of postcolonial theory. Hogan has in mind Suzanne Keen’s concept of cultivating empathy
         through complex in-group and out-group processes, when making his claim, why one should
         look for more than psychoanalysis in postcolonial studies.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the following chapter <span style="font-weight:bold">Suzanne Keen</span> revisits her concept of strategic narrative empathizing and suggests literary cognitivism
         as an alternative to postcolonial theory. In line with Hogan’s work Keen can show
         how writers of former colonized countries, hoping to reach a readership in the world
         fiction market, do not encapsulate their writing in local otherness. These novelists
         believe in human universals like empathy and Keen thereby illustrates why postcolonial
         theory should understand cognitive and emotive processes of empathizing.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">William Flesch</span> uses decision theory and game theory to analyse how poems integrate contradicting
         desires and divergent sequences of events. Readers want authors to make them want
         the outcome authors offer. The seemingly paradoxical attitude explains why we change
         our beliefs and preferences through literature. Literature offers incentives and exploits
         our desire for novel satisfactions. Fair reward and punishment are our ultimate interest
         in fiction and a biological component of fiction.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">What many autistics with their different sensitivity to figurative language can teach
         us about poetry is the topic of <span style="font-weight:bold">Ralph James Savarese’s</span> paper. Savarese’s research is especially interested in the nonsemantic aspects of
         poetry, the sensory knowing of autistic people like Tito Mukhopadhyay. In line with
         recent neuroscientific findings about the prominent role of perceptual mechanism in
         supporting cognition autism, it seems to be an entirely different processing system
         and this might explain to a certain extent the superior perceptual and more precategorial
         processing of speech that many autistics exhibit.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The difference between morality in fiction and in real life is evidently of pertinent
         importance for our understanding of the moral role of literature and film. <span style="font-weight:bold">Margrethe Bruun Vaage</span> analyses antiheroes of the television series <span style="font-style:italic">The Sopranos</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">The Wire</span> to show that we rely more heavily on moral emotions when engaging in fiction than
         in real-life events. Her case study is the depictions of rape and murder and how our
         moral emotions become more evident when we read or watch fictional stories. The repulsion
         felt towards the rapist is stronger than the repulsion felt towards the murderer,
         because we as readers of fiction use more moral emotions and intuitions than abstract
         principles.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The reader’s involvement in the moral constellation of a fictional text is possible
         through different types of empathy, sympathy and compassion. <span style="font-weight:bold">Fritz Breithaupt</span> analyses the empathic involvement of the reader in Leopoldo Alas’s <span style="font-style:italic">La Regenta</span> and Theodor Fontane’s <span style="font-style:italic">Effi Briest</span>. What his analysis reveals, is what Breithaupt calls an ›empathic sadism‹, i.e. an
         empathy which turns the main character into an object, where the reader derives pleasure
         from the suffering of the characters Ana Ozores and Effi Briest.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The cognitive unconscious, i.e. the many mental processes, which are not experienced
         consciously, is <span style="font-weight:bold">Blakey Vermeule’s</span> topic. As he points out in contrast to the ›old‹ unconscious of Freud the new unconscious
         looks much more civilized, but is hard to find in literature. Psychoanalysis is somehow
         outdated even for Vermeule and only new ways of cognitive research like Daniel Kahneman
         or careful reading of authors like Milton offers glimpses into the unconscious mind,
         when Satan finds himself becoming good almost by accident.

                       p. -->Jeff Smith</span> analyses how filmmakers make use of cognitive biases, when spectators infer behaviours
         of characters from internal traits and attributes of characters rather than from external,
         situational facts, depicted in the film scenes. Emotional reactions like curiosity,
         suspense, or surprise could be elicited by biases like the actor-observer bias or
         peak-end rule. In the sense of Smith’s analysis filmmakers are good folk psychologists.
         And again Daniel Kahneman is for Smith the social psychologist, who offers the best
         insights into how the judgments and inferences of spectators are influenced by the
         many fast routines in the head of any of us. The fast reacting cognitive processes
         are what make films lively and comprehensible. Film studies require learning from
         psychology precisely about the mechanisms ruling the understanding of characters’
         motivations and behaviours, Smith concludes.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the chapter on empirical and qualitative studies of literature <span style="font-weight:bold">Laura Otis</span> reports about a larger, qualitative study examining how people differ in the visual
         mental images they form in response to spoken or written words. Novelists inspire
         visualization and stimulate readers’ imaginations. However, each reader has her or
         his own different cognitive style of visualization. Otis uses interviews with readers
         and writers to investigate how wide mental images differ while reading or writing,
         how detailed or abstract imageries are, whether readers use a more spatial or a more
         object style. As her research shows readers vary as much as novelist in their use
         of visual mental images. Some envision in great detail characters, several incline
         more toward spatial visualisation, some read in a very abstract manner. Each has his
         or her preferred mental style. The qualitative interviews were complementary to the
         laboratory data. Otis highly encourages more interdisciplinary work between literary
         scholars and neuroscientists.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">›To be transported into a story‹ is one of the most commonly used metaphors introduced
         by Richard J. Gerrig in 1993 to capture the prototypical reading experience. Specific
         questionnaires were developed by Melanie Green and others to measure in detail what
         transportation means for readers. <span style="font-weight:bold">Marisa Bortolussi</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Peter Dixon</span> offer a critical review of some limitations of the term and pledge not to confuse
         the metaphor with the psychological reality of transport. Transportation is not an
         all-or-nothing state, rather a shifting of reader’s attention focus during the course
         of processing a text.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In their second contribution <span style="font-weight:bold">Marisa Bortolussi</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Peter Dixon</span> go into details about what happens during the act of reading over time. Although
         only little is still known about the reading process over time it can be shown by
         experimental data how readers differ on the level of story processing, discourse processing
         and personal reactions. Reader-text interaction is not one story of transportation,
         rather it depends on the content of stories, the way stories are told and the personal
         experiences and memories of readers. This is why one has to analyse the text in the
         mind of the reader and not the text in itself to fully understand what literature
         means.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The last section of the <span style="font-style:italic">Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Literary Studies</span> deals with the relation of theory and experience. Good test cases to explore the
         relation are self-reflexive narratives, theatre plays or films from Diderot to Pirandello
         or Fellini. <span style="font-weight:bold">Joshua Landy</span> argues that self-reflexive fiction can do something important for readers, i.e. to
         connect the awareness of illusion with a kind of an aesthetic redemption. In self-reflexive
         literature everything we believe is subject to doubt but the brain is capable to hold
         two or more conflicting attitudes towards the same state of affairs, be aware of it
         and be entertained by the competing attitudes, like children with imaginary companions
         are aware that these friends do not really exists but play with them regardless. It
         is a way of conscious self-deception.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Literature and realistic literature particularly create out of fragments of given
         details the impression of a fully fledged landscape, an effect Roland Barthes has
         called the reality effect. <span style="font-weight:bold">Elaine Auyoung</span> discusses the theoretical and empirical findings on discourse comprehension which
         
         <!--
                       p. -->suggests that readers make only very limited inferences out of the cues given by a
         texts. Following Marie-Laure Ryan’s principle of minimal departure, fictional worlds
         are not different from their analogues in the real world, yet fragmentary rather than
         fully determinate. As Auyoung can show a cognitive approach to the reality effect
         complicates the very fundamental concept of how we read. Filling the gaps and building
         vivid imagination out of small building blocks given by a literary text, is not a
         precise description of what reading is. Even though readers know that all is fictional,
         the longing for understanding the full extent of the fictional world beyond the given
         text is the experience literature elicits according to Auyong.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span style="font-weight:bold">Mark J. Bruhn</span> offers what he calls a cognitive update on mid-twentieth-century theories of spatial
         form and poetic function. Any spoken or written word is only temporarily present.
         Poetry resists the inevitable temporal volatility of any given words by its specific
         word orders. Poetic words are not a simple chain of grammatical utterances; they are
         composed to be recognized like older writings under the surface of newly written texts.
         Bruhn’s example for the poetic function of literature is the poetry of Wordsworth,
         <span style="font-style:italic">The Prelude</span> chiefly among them, a poetry able to let readers experience and reflect by the order
         of his words and his topic, how we as humans understand our feelings. Cognitive literary
         studies, Bruhn concludes, may reveal the hidden story of the mind behind today’s neuroscience
         and cognitive studies. Wordsworth is already aware of many cognitive and affective
         processes – like blending – which we today reformulate in the language of neuroscience
         and cognitive studies.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the last contribution <span style="font-weight:bold">Nancy Easterlin</span> explores readers’ preference for the unusual, rare, and new in literature, in texts
         like Wordsworth’s ballad <span style="font-style:italic">The Mad Mother</span>. Novelty is a feature of at least modern literature and many literary theorists like
         Viktor Shklovsky dwell on it. Easterlin integrates findings from Russian Formalism
         and reader-response theory with psychological insights into how habituation is the
         prerequisite for readers to be focused towards novelty. Unusual or defamiliarized
         texts slow down the cognitive routines, as David Miall has shown, and make readers
         aware of a more coherent and global meaning and give a better sense of the self. In
         Nancy Easterlin’s biocultural approach cognitive findings illuminate reader-response
         theories because psychology could explain the cognitive details of what is at work
         when we read.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">II.</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In sum, the <span style="font-style:italic">Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Literary studies</span> offers an encyclopaedic picture of what is today’s cognitive literary studies, with
         some shortcomings. The <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span> is diverse in the objects and methods, concepts and practices, which it encompasses.
         From narratology to very moderate postmodern approaches, from reader response theory
         and Russian Formalism to experimental findings it’s filled with a variety of innovative
         approaches. By far narratology is the most prominent analytical approach in cognitive
         literary studies according to the <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span>. And English literature is with some exception the prevalent object of the field.
         Literary criticism like queer theory or postcolonialism is now part of cognitive studies
         in literature. With this move cognitive literary studies are – unlike cognitive poetics
         – just complementary to commonly held notions about what literary studies is and fits
         smoothly into the wider area of literary criticism. By now cognitive literary studies
         are more cognitive literary criticism than literary studies and even less empirical
         psychology of literature. The days of opposites between a more scientific vs. a more
         scholarly approach are almost over following the main line of the <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span>. The prodigal son cognitive poetics is back. And indeed within one discipline there
         could be divergent questions and a plurality of problems. The same object – literature
         – could be researched for cognitive processes or for details of narrative features,
         for the cognitive biases writers or film makers use or for metric schemata in poems,
         for universal features or for idiosyncratic characteristics – so far so good.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->Some irritations still remain. First of all: Most of the papers in the handbook understood
         ›cognitive‹ as a universal quality including the quality of personal memories of readers,
         which influences heavily the cognitive processes of literary reading. Additionally
         reading literature and understanding the arts is for most of the papers not something
         exceptional and unrelated to what happens when we interact with the world in real
         life, as David Herman and others have already stressed elsewhere.<span id="Note3_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. David Herman, The Emergence of Mind. Representations of Consciousness in Narrative Discourse in English. Lincoln 2011, 8–9." href="#Note3">[3]</a></span> Not all scholars from other areas of literary studies would agree. For many scholars
         the object of literary scholarship is the text, the surrounding culture or the history,
         but not cognitive mechanisms. Cognitive processes are irrelevant for most parts of
         literary criticism and the understanding of processes before, during, and after reading
         is of no greater importance for the understanding of what makes literature unique.
         The cognitive feature most contributions to the <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook </span>accentuate is the quality of literature to make use and foster the ability of mentalising.
         Even this quality is for most parts of literary studies simply irrelevant. These scholars
         already presume the value of literature and would not analyse the question of what
         mental processes give literature its value. Roughly speaking cognitive literary studies
         asks quite different questions of literature than the rest of literary scholarship.
         It works on a different, often anthropological level, a level which is of no greater
         interest for most literary scholars. That is why in contrast to the mainstream in
         literary studies cognitive approaches form a particular field in the wide sea of literary
         studies. They ask different questions and this is also why parts of cognitive literary
         studies use other methods than commonly used. Because it’s questioning what is often
         taken for granted, cognitive literary studies is the Northwest Passage of literary
         studies, not the common route and not institutionalised like cognitive linguistics.
         The <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook </span>diminishes the differences between the fields of literary studies.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Secondly: The <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span> excluded some approaches, foremost any evolutionary perspective. This makes no sense,
         because cognitive studies rely heavily on evolutionary assumption. By no accident
         have some of the contributors like H. Porter Abbott also worked on evolutionary literary
         studies. But for the editor the evolutionary approach from Jonathan Gottschall and
         others is too science-orientated. In this regard the <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook </span>is frankly programmatic. It is its goal to establish cognitive literary studies as
         normal scholarship with no rough edges for established humanities. The price it pays
         is that it offers mainly a weak form of cognitive studies, although some contributions
         to the <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span> are just cognitive psychology and even neuroscience and do not really fit under the
         programmatic exclusion of more science-oriented approaches. It would do well to look
         into the content of journals like <span style="font-style:italic">Poetic, Poetic Today, Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts </span>or <span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Study of Literature</span>, to name only some prominent examples, to get a sense, that the field of cognitive
         literary studies is wider and has more methodological strength than the <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span> suggests. The variety of research by Barbara Dancygier, Karl Eibl, Catherine Emmott,
         Melanie Green, Frank Hakemulder, Arthur Jacobs, Max Louwerse, Raymond Mar, Keith Oatley,
         Elena Semino, Peter Stockwell, Mikkel Wallentin or Rolf Zwaan, to name again only
         some distinguished names, or the theoretical debates around mentalising by Shaun Gallagher,
         Daniel Hutto or Dan Zahavi are not part of the <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span>, but certainly of the field. Important issues of the field like event segmentation,
         overimitation, or methodological issues of brain imaging are touched only marginally.
         The list of missing names and methodologies could easily be longer. The field of cognitive
         literary studies has a strong empirical and experimental branch and includes definitely
         also biopoetics and other evolutionary approaches. There is no plausible reason to
         exclude them.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In a similar vein the limits of the strong emphasis on mentalization are only accidently
         discussed. By stressing the importance of understanding other minds many approaches
         lost their sense for the composition of the poetic texts, for its higher symbolic
         meaning and the status as a work of art. The details of cognitive exchanges between
         reader, text, and writer tend to vaporise the literary text as an experienced whole.
         The role of personal memories, the importance of literature for life narratives, as
         well as striking techniques of foregrounding and many other 
         <!--
                       p. -->findings especially revealed by cognitive approaches in literary studies are omitted.
         The power of literature is occasionally in the focus and more distinct models of literary
         reading integrating role-taking and defamiliarization concepts are not taken into
         consideration.<span id="Note4_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. Emy Koopman/Frank Hakemulder, Effects of Literature on Empathy and Self-reflection: A Theoretical-empirical Framework, Journal of Literary Theory…" href="#Note4">[4]</a></span> This is of course a general problem for cognitive approaches in literary studies.
         With a view on the wider field of cognitive approaches in literary studies like for
         example the work of Keith Oatley we could learn how to integrate the analysis of details
         in understanding literature with the overall impact of literature. A more systematic
         discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of cognitive literary studies would be
         helpful but is not a topic here.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Of course a collection of papers is always biased and has the right to be focused.
         But a handbook? It should be more, not a collection by accident or programmatic decision,
         but an overview of the area. This is not exactly the case with the <span style="font-style:italic">Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Literary Studies.</span> It offers not a systematic mapping and the articles are not written with systematic
         pretence. They offer fabulous insights into new and often very inspiring research
         of this or that scholar and provide plenty of food for thought and findings for further
         scrutiny. Nonetheless a map of the field would look different.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">And one last point: To use cognitive concepts comes at a cost. Cognitive studies are
         a rapidly evolving area. Even major concepts change fast. Frameworks like the Bayesian
         brain or the social brain, concepts like default network or theory of mind, and terms
         like empathy are in a constant readjustment by the bulk of research done in cognitive
         psychology and neurosciences every day. To only pick out some of the terms, concepts
         or framework is not enough. Scholars, who make use of cognitive insights and contributed
         to cognitive studies in general, are obliged to track the developments in cognitive
         sciences. Cognitive literary studies are in danger of skimming some cognitive terms
         and concepts. Of course cognitive literary studies are part of literary studies but
         they are also part of cognitive studies and the rules of this group of disciplines
         are different to those in the humanities. A loose use of terms and concepts will de-professionalise
         literary studies at least in the eyes of cognitive scientists. On the other hand a
         strong use of these concepts and terms will separate cognitive literary studies from
         the rest of literary criticism. Cognitive linguistics and some decades ago psychology
         changed their disciplinary positions from the humanities to the natural sciences,
         naturally with gains and losses. The <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span> has chosen a middle course to keep cognitive literary studies in the humanities.
         Here lies the rub. There is no exact middle course. Each approach in cognitive literary
         studies has to make a hard decision where to side with every new research.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Let’s try to take stock: The <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook </span>is impressive. The wealth of ideas and concepts contained within the volume certainly
         makes for an inspiring read. This growing area of scholarship holds out the promise
         of engaging with concepts and methods in ways that allow new types of knowledge formation
         in literary studies. Still cognitive literary studies are not yet a clearly defined
         field and definitely more than just the next turn. As a reader, I sometimes had the
         impression that the title chosen – <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span> – may not have been the most adequate one, since the book often reads like a catalogue,
         albeit of current and inspiring research. The argument advanced here is, however,
         that cognitive literary studies sit on the fence. The <span style="font-style:italic">Handbook</span> is the encyclopedic invitation to meditate over the course of cognitive literary
         studies in the upcoming years.

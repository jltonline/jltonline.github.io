      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">Robyn Warhol/Susan S. Lanser (eds.), <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative Theory Unbound: Queer and Feminist Interventions</span>. Columbus, OH: The Ohio State University Press 2015. X, 398 pp. [Preis: EUR 83,50].
         ISBN: 978-0-8142-1280-6.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">As <span style="font-weight:bold">Robyn Warhol</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Susan S. Lanser</span> explain in the introduction to their co-edited volume, its title including »a term
         of Promethean audacity« is in reference to »a field that is no stranger to derivations
         from the Greek« (1). Yet, paradoxically, part of what feminist and, more recently,
         queer approaches have been up against is precisely narratology’s structuralist legacy
         of a formalist, ahistorical and frequently Greek-inflected inventory of terms and
         distinctions. What is more, the field’s male and masculinist outlook in terms of founding
         representatives and concepts, as well as possible heteronormative connotations of
         narrative as a forward-driven phenomenon putatively in line with a reproductive imperative
         do not exactly add to making narrative theory a likely candidate for feminist and
         queer appropriation. In any case, the mythological metaphor in the present volume’s
         title underscores the titanic measure of the task at hand. It is taken up by an interdisciplinary
         group of US-based scholars working with narrative, feminist and/or queer theory, who
         met for a Project Narrative Symposium organized by Warhol in 2011 and whose contributions
         are gathered in the collection under review.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">One of the major strengths of <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative Theory Unbound</span> is that it succeeds in preserving, as much as possible, the lively, multivoiced and
         also conflicting discussions of the original symposium. Fifteen full-length essays
         are arranged in four large sections, with another set of five shorter response essays
         called »commentaries« coming in the volume’s fifth part, which in turn is followed
         by a concluding afterword. The commentaries review closely the preceding contributions
         and draw or highlight connections, maintaining a sense of the dynamic, back-and-forth
         character of oral debate and conversation, which is complemented by frequent cross-references
         within and between the longer essays. Because of the linearity of print, the result
         is not quite a »hypertext« (16), as Warhol and Lanser suggest might be fitting, but
         the volume is not a streamlined, let alone definitive account, either. It deliberately
         chooses open-endedness over closure and strict teleology, and as an academic publication
         productively enacts qualities which feminist and queer critics have found to be underrepresented
         in the study of narrative.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This quasi hypertext provides an undogmatic and flexible framework in which to take
         stock of past achievements and sound out future prospects of queer and feminist narrative
         theory. Given the proliferation and marketability of cultural and context-sensitive,
         so-called ›postclassical‹ narratologies over the past few decades, such a collaborative,
         volume-long consideration seems almost overdue. Feminist approaches are rightly credited
         with pioneering contextualizing readings of narrative by building cultural aspects
         like sex and gender into the formalist analyses of ›classical‹ structuralist narratology.
         Lanser’s and Warhol’s own individual work in formative articles and monographs from
         the 1980s onwards is frequently invoked in the pages of <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative Theory Unbound</span>. However, this is the first collection of feminist narrative criticism 
         <!--
                       p. -->in almost twenty years, as the editors point out, and the first-ever collection of
         queer narrative theory.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Generally, the essays gathered are written in a spirit of »exhortation over celebration«
         (40), to borrow a phrase from Lanser’s contribution »Toward (a Queerer and) More (Feminist)
         Narratology«. To be sure, celebration plays a big part as well, not least by dint
         of many personal anecdotes which lend the book an air of collective memoir, of a field
         in which the lines between academia and activism are characteristically blurred. As
         for exhortation, the essays can be seen to delineate and already practice one or several
         of four major directions of future research in combination: a continued or renewed
         interest in form and the critical apparatus of narratology; a concern with intersectionality
         theory; a call for extending canons of texts against which queer and feminist readings
         have been tested; and inclusion of non-literary and non-fictional narratives as well
         as interdisciplinary projects.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">While the four directions or foci of this research agenda do not square neatly with
         the volume’s four main sections, in fact often cut across them, including the fifth
         section of commentaries, the case for ›more‹ narratology is arguably most pronounced
         in Lanser’s programmatic essay, which opens the volume’s first section »Narrative
         Discourse Unbound«. In it, she reemphasizes the role of narrative form as cultural
         content and raises the question, among others, whether free indirect discourse might
         be revalued as a particular formal strategy employed by writers like Henry James,
         Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield in their capacity as »queer(ish) folk as well
         as modernists« (31). The other essays in the volume’s first section are similarly
         invested in aspects of form. In »Out of the Bind: From Structure to System in Popular
         Narratives«, <span style="font-weight:bold">Judith Roof</span> analyses a wide range of remakes of »Little Red Riding Hood«, arguing that these
         and the gender concepts inscribed in the fairy-tale are not reducible to an underlying
         structural pattern of binary elements, but the result of narrative as a multiply recombinant
         system which »offers conceptual tools for revising the impasses of gender inequality«
         (57). In »Giving an Account of Themselves: Metanarration and the Structure of Address
         in <span style="font-style:italic">The Office</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">The Real Housewives</span>«, Robyn Warhol details how by using metanarration and a different camera-mediated
         form of address, which directly involves the audience, the former show manages to
         convey gendered subjectivity in a way that paradoxically feels more ›real‹ than in
         the latter. <span style="font-weight:bold">Peggy Phelan</span>, in her essay »Hypothetical Focalization and Queer Grief«, turns to this term coined
         by David Herman for a type of focalization entertained as conceivable but not realized
         in a given text, suggesting that it »seems particularly valuable for reading queer
         autobiographies« in which »a hypothetical perspective about sexuality becomes a requisite
         one for the narrator« (83).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The essays in the second section, »Intersectional Narrative Theories«, all enrich
         feminist and queer readings by correlating sex and gender, and accommodating their
         intersections, with additional identity categories such as race, class, and region.
         Religion, as another important but so far little studied factor is added in <span style="font-weight:bold">Susan Stanford Friedman’s</span> instructive genre-mapping discussion of the female Muslim <span style="font-style:italic">bildungsroman</span> in »Religion, Intersectionality, and Queer/Feminist Narrative Theory: The <span style="font-style:italic">Bildungsromane</span> of Ahdaf Soueif, Leila Aboulela, and Randa Jarrar«. Drawing on her complex previous
         work on narrative empathy, <span style="font-weight:bold">Suzanne Keen</span> combines intersectionality with a promising interdisciplinary perspective for queer
         and feminist approaches in »Intersectional Narratology in the Study of Narrative Empathy«.
         <span style="font-weight:bold">Sue J. Kim</span> pursues similar questions in »Empathy and 1970s Novels by Third World Women«, while
         again bringing aspects of race, class, and location into the picture. Taken together,
         the three essays offer a welcome and much-needed complication of queer and feminist
         analyses in and of the West, importantly also by turning to new bodies of texts.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->In »Lifewriting, Gender, Sex«, the collection’s third section, the value of new canons,
         including non-fictional and non-literary narratives, as well as of interdisciplinary
         collaboration is further demonstrated. In »Screenshots in the <span style="font-style:italic">Longue Durée</span>: Feminist Narratology, Digital Humanities, and Collective Biographies of Women«,
         <span style="font-weight:bold">Alison Booth</span> presents a project on identifying patterns in a database of nineteenth- and twentieth-century
         short biographies of famous women. Her essay offers a point of convergence with Lanser’s
         interest in empirical methods such as Franco Moretti’s concept of ›distant reading‹,
         for the possibility it might offer to trace feminist- and queer-inflected narrative
         forms across a wider geographical and temporal space. In »The Space of Graphic Narrative:
         Mapping Bodies, Feminism, and Form«, <span style="font-weight:bold">Hillary Chute</span> adds a topical genre to the debate and explores its autobiographical potential for
         women writers and for feminist criticism. The remaining two essays in this section
         attend to queer lifewriting. Both »The Narrative Case for Queer Biography« by <span style="font-weight:bold">Wendy Moffat</span>, author of a biography of E.M. Forster, and <span style="font-weight:bold">Jesse Matz</span> in his »›No Future‹ vs. ›It Gets Better‹: Queer Prospects for Narrative Temporality«
         document but also modify existing scepticism against temporality and teleological
         narrative in queer theory.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In »Emplotment, or the Shapes of Stories«, section four of <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative Theory Unbound</span>, the first two essays explore topics related to queer lives and life stories, with
         <span style="font-weight:bold">Paul Morrison</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Valerie Rohy</span> reading two classics of the queer literary corpus in »<span style="font-style:italic">Maurice</span>, or Coming Out Straight« and »Strange Influence: Queer Etiology in <span style="font-style:italic">The Picture of Dorian Gray</span>« respectively. By contrast, the other two contributions in this section turn to somewhat
         different narratives and disciplines. Thus, in her essay, <span style="font-weight:bold">Susan Fraiman</span> looks at »Gendered Narratives in Animal Studies«, while <span style="font-weight:bold">Kay Young</span> engages with stories told by neuroscientists about sex, gender and the brain in »Sex–Text–Cortex«.
         Specifically, Young rejects »narratives which define us in terms of a crude biological
         determinism« (316), and highlights the ways in which these construct notions of gender
         identity and sexual orientation, rather than presenting scientific facts.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Tellingly entitled »Challenges: Un/doing Narrative Theory«, the book’s fifth section
         assembles five commentaries by <span style="font-weight:bold">Abby Coykendall</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">Martin Joseph Ponce</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">Claudia Breger</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">Ellen Peel</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Shalyn Claggett</span>. It is worth singling out two of the more provocative voices, which underline the
         collection’s deliberately provisional character, hinted at by Warhol and Lanser at
         the end of their introduction: »our story is not likely to come to closure any time
         soon« (19). In the commentaries, this goes for discussions around individual essays
         as well as for notes of warning about the volume’s project at large. Thus, in »Towards
         a Queer Feminism; Or, Feminist Theories and/as Queer Narrative Studies«, Coykendall
         suspects lingering hierarchies and orders of precedence in which the debate is framed.
         With a view to paratexts such as the collection’s title she points out a »tacit primacy
         granted to narrative theory over either feminist or queer theory« and warns against
         treating the latter »as derivations of the historically phallocentric institution
         of narratology« (326). She also prefers »narrative studies« as a more flexible and
         interdisciplinary rubric over the »exclusionary legacy of an ›ology‹« (332). In his
         »Queer/Feminist/Narrative: On the Limits of Reciprocal Engagement«, Ponce expresses
         similar reservations when he objects to »narrative theory’s imperialist appropriation
         (its treatment of narratives by women, sexual dissidents, or racial and colonized
         others as ›raw material‹ for testing out the reach of theoretical frameworks)« (335).
         Moreover, he is sceptical of the supposedly easy intersectional alliance between feminist
         or queer and ethnic studies, observing that »although queer theory has acknowledged
         intellectual and political debts to feminism, it has nonetheless tended to elide the
         work of theorists and activists of color« (337–338).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">No doubt a landmark publication, it is to the credit of <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative Theory Unbound</span> that it accommodates constructive dissent on precisely how to unbind narrative theory,
         or whether at all, and on how to tie narratology or narrative studies to feminist
         and queer concerns in turn. 
         <!--
                       p. -->This Promethean task is positively unfinished and ongoing, but the present volume
         covers some crucial new ground and will be indispensable reading for scholars working
         in the fields of narratology, queer and feminist studies. The articles collected significantly
         expand extant studies of narrative form from the perspective of gender and sexuality,
         and they combine their analyses in novel ways with interdisciplinary and contextualist
         approaches from areas as diverse as the digital humanities, neuronarrative research,
         intersectionality theory, and postcolonial studies. Whether and how these lines of
         enquiry will be taken up will also depend on greater resonance with mainstream narratological
         debates in a situation where recent anthologies have given only little room to issues
         of sex and gender, as Coykendall laments, pointing to a larger »ongoing devaluation
         of feminist and queer studies« (328). Another open question, highlighted by <span style="font-weight:bold">Irene Kancendes</span> in her afterword, concerns the »Anglocentrism« (367) of North American academia.
         This is a question of canons and texts as well as of which scholarly communities select,
         read and discuss them with which other communities. For the time being, the present
         collection is a tribute to the intellectual and institutional context it is facilitated
         by, while it might also be culturally specific to it.

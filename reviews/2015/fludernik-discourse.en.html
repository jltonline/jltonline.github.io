      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">Patrick Colm Hogan, Narrative Discourse: Authors and Narrators in Literature, Film,
         and Art. Columbus, Ohio: Ohio State University Press 2013. 301 p. [Price: USD 79.95].
         ISBN: 978-0814212097.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In this very accessibly written book Patrick Colm Hogan tries to reconceptualize narratology
         from a discourse studies perspective (hence the title <span style="font-style:italic">Narrative Discourse</span>). He particularly concentrates on the questions of author and narrator, proposing
         partially new terminology and an extended diagram of narrative communication. The
         study distinguishes itself from many other narratological monographs by focusing on
         a fairly limited number of issues (rather than attempting a new typology, for instance),
         and by using painting as well as film for its material of analysis. Moreover, Hogan
         resorts to both postcolonial texts and the Indian tradition of aesthetic criticism,
         thus adding a multicultural perspective. Central to Hogan’s approach are also his
         knowledge of cognitive studies and his interest in emotions (see his <span style="font-style:italic">Affective Narratology</span>, 2011).
      </p>
      <!---->
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The study is divided into an Introduction and six chapters plus an Afterword. The
         Introduction sets discourse narratology into a framework of discourse analysis, explaining
         that the focus of the book lies on discourse or communication and that it thus propounds
         »the continuity between literary narrative and other forms of narrative production
         and reception« (11). Hogan then goes on to enumerate the »purposes of reading«, which
         are thematic. He lists as, one, the represented, or plot; second, emotion on the level
         of story and empathy, but also on the level of discourse (curiosity, suspense); and,
         third, »any norm – particularly an ethical or political norm – that carries over from
         the narrative to the real world« (18). He then links narrative discourse analysis
         with interpretation and its »profile of ambiguity« (19–20)
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->Chapter 1, »Who is Speaking to Whom – The Communicative Discourse of Narrative Art«,
         concentrates on the author, the narrator and particularly the implied author, briefly
         mentioning focalization, and then turns to some new proposals. Hogan distinguishes
         between <span style="font-style:italic">personified </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">nonpersonified </span>narrators (40–41) and introduces the term <span style="font-style:italic">topicalization </span>to deal with the text’s focus on a protagonist who is not the focalizer (<span style="font-style:italic">The Great Gatsby</span>). In elucidating his defense of the implied author, he resorts to the Sanskrit notion
         of <span style="font-style:italic">sahṛdaya</span> – the reader’s cognitive empathy with the author.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Chapter 2 concentrates on Rabindranath Tagore’s paintings (rather than poetry or fiction)
         and reads these narratively. The choice of painting as a <span style="font-style:italic">pièce de résistance</span> for narratology is well taken (though there is more work on it than Hogan quotes).
         By way of metaphor (Sanskrit <span style="font-style:italic">dhvani</span>) and the emotional response (<span style="font-style:italic">rasa</span>) Hogan explicates a series of paintings which are, however, extremely ambiguous and
         difficult to interpret with any confidence. He then turns to filmic <span style="font-style:italic">auteurism</span> (asking how there can be an <span style="font-style:italic">author</span>, or implied author, for a film even though so many people are responsible for the
         final product). The subsequent discussion of Bimal Roy’s film <span style="font-style:italic">Madhumati </span>(1958) foregrounds the transition between present and past (memory of a former incarnation),
         but does not clearly link to the author topic. The conclusion of the chapter proposes
         the existence of »cross-textual implied authorship« (109), which is constructed from
         recurring themes and »receptive, implied authorial intent« (110).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->Chapter 3, »Authors, Implied and Implicated«, proposes that there can be several audiences
         for a narrative (Hogan bases his argument on an article by Brian Richardson from 2007,
         but does not mention Kubowitz’s incisive analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">Style</span> 46.2 [2012] – probably in print when he completed his manuscript). This thesis is
         illustrated in two excellent readings, one of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s <span style="font-style:italic">Uncle Tom’s Cabin</span> (1852) and the other of Kabir Khan’s film <span style="font-style:italic">New York</span> (2009). In order to distinguish a global implied author from a contradictory viewpoint
         in local passages in a text, Hogan coins the term <span style="font-style:italic">implicated author</span>. He moreover suggests that the author may introduce deliberate contradiction through
         what he calls <span style="font-style:italic">misdirection</span> by seeming to convey one message (which is politically acceptable) while actually
         wanting to propose the contradictory point of view also present in the film (<span style="font-style:italic">New York</span>). This strategy has of course been much discussed in Shakespeare criticism, and –
         particularly given Hogan’s transmedial interests – it is odd that he does not resort
         to this literature.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Chapter 4 continues the concern with implied narrators by focusing on »narrative reliability«.
         Hogan acknowledges our propensity to trust nonpersonalized narrators since they are
         in a position of »authority« (155) and agrees with Ansgar Nünning’s emphasis on the
         norms of the narrative and with Marie-Laure Ryan’s »principle of minimal departure«
         and with Tamar Yacobi’s work on naturalizing textual oddity. To this he adds a foray
         into cognitive studies, pointing to »default preference rules« (161–2) that determine
         readers’ interpretative strategies. His example text is Margaret Atwood’s 1972 novel
         <span style="font-style:italic">Surfacing</span>, in which the protagonist has repressed her abortion and only comes to recover the
         truth when she is diving and then surfaces from the water and from the lies that she
         has been telling.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Chapters 5 and 6 focus on multiple narration. This includes »embedded, collective,
         and parallel« (183) narratives. Parallel narratives treat either the <span style="font-style:italic">same</span> facts (conjunctive) or different ones (disjunctive – 184). The chapter goes on to
         concentrate on »mentalistic narration«, i.e. the representation of consciousness,
         distinguishing »<span style="font-style:italic">self-conscious</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">un-self-conscious</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">implicit</span> narration« (189), the latter in interior monologue. The example is William Faulkner’s
         <span style="font-style:italic">The Sound and the Fury</span> (1929), of which Hogan provides a very interesting reading, noting among other things
         that while Jason is motivated by his dread of being ridiculed and represses his personal
         responsibility for his failures completely, Quentin on the other hand exaggerates
         his own guilt for events. The second example is David Lynch’s <span style="font-style:italic">Mulholland Drive</span> (2001), a film in which it cannot be determined whether the two narratives are embedded
         in one another and which of them is the primary narrative. In Chapter 6 the emphasis
         is on collective narration, with sections on we-narrative and on what Hogan calls
         »collective focalization« (presenting the world through the eyes of a group) in Ngugi
         wa Thiong’o’s <span style="font-style:italic">Petals of Blood </span>(1977) and in the 1988 Namibian novel <span style="font-style:italic">Born of the Sun</span> by Joseph Diescho and Celeste Wallin. The chapter provides very interesting discussions
         of the two novels and significantly adds to narratological work on collectivity.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The Afterword extends the intergeneric analysis one more time by providing a highly
         sophisticated reading of a poem by the sixteenth-century Hindi poet Mirabai.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Having given readers a sense of the range of issues and texts covered in Hogan’s study,
         I turn to a discussion of his narratological proposals, a discussion which can be
         titled ‘The Problems with Hogan’s Discourse Analysis Approach to Narrative’. There
         are three major problems that beset this book. The first of these is audience-related.
         The book reads like an introduction to narratology, systematically discussing narrative
         instances and levels of narrative engagement. It sets out its theses, taking issue
         with some of the existing narratological criticism (the bibliography is fairly slim
         and fails to mention much pertinent criticism), but nowhere addresses the central
         question it raises in every narratologist’s mind when reading this study: Why are
         his revisions of narratological terminology and concepts necessary, what is their
         advantage over 
         <!--
                       p. -->previous narratologies? Hogan seems to address a student audience, but then he provides
         such extensive discussion of minute distinctions, assuming for instance that every
         reader knows what Prince’s »un-narrated« refers to (170), that a real student would
         become entirely confused. Yet for the full-scale narratologist he provides too much
         basic information and then skips over or skimps on the discussion of why his revisions
         should be preferable to well-known narratological work. There is, therefore, a failure
         here to conceptualize exactly what audience(s) will be reading this study, or Hogan
         has become so enamored of multiple implicated readers that he wishes to sacrifice
         argumentative consistency over broad appeal.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The second problem with this book lies in its narrator/implied/implicated author model
         with its set of analogical personae on the reception side. Rather like Genette, Hogan
         extends the pool of terminological distinctions by adding a considerable number of
         new terms to the narratological lexicon. However, unlike Genette, whose procedure
         is a model of clarity and persuasiveness, Hogan’s book is often both unclear and not
         entirely convincing in its multiplication of terminology. Right at the outset, for
         instance, in the Introduction, the relationship between linguistic discourse analysis,
         critical discourse analysis, and narrative discourse analysis remains obscure since
         in fact linguistic discourse analysis <span style="font-style:italic">includes</span> narrative discourse analysis or overlaps with it. The entire alignment of narratology
         with discourse analysis can be argued to be quite spurious, since all it really seems
         to foreground is the underlining of a communication model as fundamental to narratology,
         renamed narrative discourse analysis. In fact, Hogan’s politics of communication closely
         resembles Roger Sell’s plea for a communicative take on narrative in his book <span style="font-style:italic">Literature as Communication: The Foundations of Mediating Criticism</span> (2000), which Hogan does not cite.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">There are several diagrams in Hogan’s book with increasingly baroque embeddings of
         the communicatorial levels. Thus, on page 63, he proposes the following model for
         the »communicative part of discourse«: 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext">Real Author [Implied Author, guided by partially »autonomous« imagined agents [Nonpersonified
         Narrator {Personified Narrator {Focalizer {Topicalizer}} Personified Narratee} Nonpersonified
         Narratee] Implied Reader/Sahrdaya] Real Reader/Critic.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Even if one were in agreement regarding the existence of an implied author as a communicative
         agent (which I am not), the embedding of focalizers and (non)personalized narrators
         makes little sense, much less with a topicalizer and implicated authors and readers
         thrown in for good measure in Chapter 3. Besides defaulting on the values of Occam’s
         razor so signally ignored by Hogan (see, for instance, his distinctions between »rhetorical
         embedding« vs. »idealized embedded narration« – 223–4; the invention of an »implicit
         subtextual template« – 225), these many distinctions are not sufficiently clearly
         presented and strike the reader as a gratuitous expansion of Genettean terminology.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">What I personally found most troubling in Hogan’s study was the recurring suggestion
         that implied narrative instances communicate, even speak, whereas – as Hogan himself
         says at the outset – they are only constructed images of the author function or of
         the reception process. For instance, on page 115 Hogan claims that in »authorial intrusion[s]«,
         »the voice of the author and the voice of the narrator are (temporarily) conflated«.
         Surely, it cannot be the actual author, but only what we reconstruct as the views
         of the author and hence the <span style="font-style:italic">implied </span>author (since he has one) whose views may be imposed on the narrator (if that narrator
         has a different world view elsewhere). Problematically, on page 192 »the implied author
         chooses a <span style="font-style:italic">fully idealized verbalization</span> in stream-of-consciousness writing«. Not only does Hogan imply that interior monologues
         have narrators; to have the lexical choices of the text <span style="font-style:italic">originate</span> in an <span style="font-style:italic">implied author</span> goes against the entire tradition of narratology. In Hogan’s analysis of the Mirabai
         poem in the 
         <!--
                       p. -->Afterword he says that »the poem presents a personified narrator who is not distinguished
         from the nonpersonified narrator, who is in turn not distinguished from the implied
         author« (253). This is a poem with a speaker; I am certain that very few narratologists
         would see this poem as <span style="font-style:italic">narrative</span> in any consensual sense of that term. At the end of the reading, Hogan even speculates
         about a »marital relationship between the implied reader and the narratee« (258).
         The proliferation of reader and narrator roles in this interpretation is stunning
         and creates a large number of theoretical conundrums, whereas a reading that simply
         noted that the poem is addressed to Krishna, but that other possible addressees might
         conceivably be hinted at, avoids much unnecessary terminology and the personification
         of speculative communicational instances.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Similar problems arise when in Chapter 6 a »focalized narrator may infer a state or
         may present the state as if he or she had direct access to it« (238). This is part
         of a discussion of theory of mind, but one wonders whether this should have been a
         <span style="font-style:italic">focalizing</span> narrator. Curiously, the »nonpersonified narrator« of <span style="font-style:italic">Born of the Sun</span>, who <span style="font-style:italic">focalizes</span> on the character Muronga, is said to have »some general knowledge of several languages
         unknown to Muronga« (241). Who ever believed a covert narrator needs to completely
         avoid narratorial language even if there is consistent internal focalization? In fact,
         if the peculiarities of the narrator stick out, he cannot be nonpersonified. (Incidentally,
         the distinction between personified and nonpersonified narrator has been in use since
         Franz Karl Stanzel’s model for decades under the shape of the ›personalized narrator‹.)
         The oddity here also seems to connect with Hogan’s definition of the focalizer, who
         »is located more squarely within the storyworld. Moreover, the focalizer does not
         directly communicate story representations with anyone« (26). Since we have a nonpersonalized
         narrator in this novel, where exactly do we locate the story-internal focalizer?
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">As my comments suggest, Hogan’s study ultimately raises more questions than it answers.
         Nevertheless, as initially indicated, some of the distinctions and issues introduced
         in this book are worth integrating into narratological discussions. One would not
         want to throw these babies out with the bathwater.

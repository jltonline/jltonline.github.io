      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Titel_Rezension">Culture, Text, and Mind: Bridging the Gap between Cognition and History in the Study
         of Literature
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">Mark J. Bruhn/Donald R. Wehrs (ed.), Cognition, Literature, and History. New York/London:
         Routledge 2014. 284 p. [Price: $ 145,00]. ISBN: 978-0-415-72209-4.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Literature flanked by cognition and history. With this programmatic approach co-editors
         Mark J. Bruhn and Donald R. Wehrs present the shared aim of the twelve essays in this
         volume, namely »to investigate the complex intersections of the three domains specified
         in the title – <span style="font-style:italic">Cognition, Literature and History</span> – in order to advance the interdisciplinary discussion and research in poetics, literary
         history, and cognitive science.« (1) Taking literature as the point of departure and
         the focus of the analysis, the authors and editors seek to combine the concepts and
         models of cognitive science with historical methods in literary studies to provide
         an account of literature that bridges the divide between form or stylistics and history
         or context. This chasm of poetics and hermeneutics has marked the history of literary
         criticism, from structuralism to post-structuralism and new historicism, and has equally
         influenced the more recent field of cognitive literary studies. Since its early days
         in the 1990s, with the seminal work on the correlation of textual patterns and reading
         effects (Tsur 1992), and on shared structures of language and thought as products
         of a cognitively modern human mind (Turner 1991, 1996), two decades of intense work
         have followed, marked by multiple directions, as the christening of this new interdisciplinary
         field demonstrates: Cognitive Poetics (Tsur 1992; Stockwell 2002; Gavis/Steen 2003),
         Cognitive Stylistics (Semino/Culpeper 2002), Cognitive Narratology (Jahn 1997, Herman
         2003), Evolutionary Literary Theory (Eibl 2004). The branching of the epistemological
         union of cognitive science and literary studies reflects the advance in the related
         fields of cognitive linguistics, neuroaesthetics and evolutionary psychology. With
         its new agenda, the cognitive approach to literature has focused primarily on the
         cognitive conditions that enable the production and fruition of literary texts, often
         pushing to the background the historical embedding and contextual reception of literary
         works. However, it is an established fact that cognition is more than a matter of
         the single brain, and rather takes place much in as out of our heads (Noë 2009), in
         an environment that for human beings is naturally cultural. Social cognition and intersubjectivity
         are key features of the way we make sense of the world and of experience. In fact,
         most literature is about the unfolding of social, contextual interactions.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Thus the study of literature needs to include a historical dimension that for the
         most part has remained unaddressed in the cognitive approach. The human mind is the
         result of a long and slow evolutionary process, but it is also situated and manifested
         in a historical dimension that changes at a much faster pace. If literature is an
         infant in the evolutionary scale, it is also a venerable constant through places and
         times of change. A cognitive dimension in the study of literature allows us to relate
         this cultural product with mental phenomena and to understand how literature changes
         minds (Kidd/Castano 2013, Nünning 2014). A historical dimension helps overcome the
         fallacy of applying cognitive concepts to literary texts often providing »painfully
         obvious« interpretations (Jackson 2005, 258) by contextualizing the texts in their
         historical significance.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">With its programmatic intersection of cognition, literature and history, Bruhn and
         Wehrs’ volume sets the agenda for a cognitive historicism that addresses the text,
         unveils the mind and 
         <!--
                       p. -->provides historical significance. The four parts of the volume address issues of genre,
         affect, theory of mind and criticism, recruiting the three fields for a more comprehensive
         understanding of these overarching problems.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Part I brings together »Cognitive Genre Theory and History«, in an exploration of
         »Kinds of (Literary) Cognition«. Genre is a category that lends itself to a cognitive
         approach, when viewed as schemata (as proposed by Hanenberg/Brandt 2010). The question
         that permeates this first part is how genres, as cognitive structures or ways of framing
         experience, correlate with historical time; in other words, how genres as schematic
         representation of experience evolve through time and context. Opening this section,
         David Duff traces the study of the ode to the contributions of Enlightenment and Romantic
         criticism. Based on these early insights he suggests the concept of lyric transport
         to account for the effect engendered by this genre. Involving a double attention shift,
         from the pragmatic to the aesthetic use of language, and from regular thinking and
         feeling to intensified emotional involvement, lyric transport helps explain how the
         reader is accelerated to high feelings and slowed down to the perception of the form,
         a process that can be described and modulated, therefore lending itself to a cognitive
         oriented study of attention, emotion and how language drives the two.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Using blending theory, Michael Sinding traces the evolution of epistolarity, from
         ordinary forms of language and exchange, through progressive differentiation based
         on a diversification of functions: from factual to fictional settings, from actual
         to imagined addressees. This evolution, in which later epistolary genres integrate
         forms and functions of previous primary genres in new blended formats, bears witness
         to the development of the mind in historical time: understanding genre formation implies
         understanding the imaginative processes by which primary genres are integrated and
         transformed into secondary genres under specific contextual conditions.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The consideration of literary genres brings with it the issue of canonicity, which
         Nancy Easterlin approaches in combination with novelty. Easterlin analyses novelty
         in narrative thought, as a pattern for organizing information, events and agents in
         a coherent structure. If on the one hand narrative is a way of repeating action sequences,
         which in evolutionary terms are essential for survival, it is also an organizing frame
         the human mind uses to deal with novelty and with the change of those patterns. Applying
         this idea to literary narrative, and taking the literary romance as her case in point,
         Easterlin claims that narrative provides a safe haven for experimenting with and challenging
         patterns, so as to enhance and broaden knowledge, which otherwise would be limited
         to routine narrativizing. Once habituation is created to respond to what is familiar,
         attention is drawn to what is unusual and new. The propensity for literary novelty
         is a cultural manifestation of this evolved capacity to attend to the unexpected.
         In this context, the preference for certain kinds of novelty is framed by the cultural
         environment in which it occurs. Easterlin’s idea resonates the sociocultural view
         of creativity, namely that a (cultural) product is creative when it is judged to be
         both novel and valuable (see, for instance, Sawyer 2012). Assessing and praising something
         as creative requires a cultural context, which renders such evaluation meaningful.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The idea of novelty recurs in Katja Mellmann’s text, in which she explores how cultural
         products influence conceptualizations of the world, often taking a central role when
         segments of reality are experientially unfamiliar. This is often the case with ideologies.
         In a similar line to Easterlin, Mellmann claims that the mind is most attracted to
         scenarios that combine recurrence of features with novel variations, and draws a parallel
         between this feature of cognition and the modes of production of cultural industry,
         in line with Adorno and Horkheimer. The representations (mediatic, artistic) of realities
         using high degrees of experientiality award viewers a tacit knowledge (as described
         by Hanenberg 2011) of such realities that does not 
         <!--
                       p. -->drive from the subject’s own experience or explicit beliefs. Mellmann addresses the
         high degree of immersion (or transportation, as mentioned by Duff) in the reception
         of cultural products, often bypassing reflection and distance, and traces this reception
         mode to two features of evolved experiential learning: induction or the capacity to
         form general norms from single instances of experience, and the emotional adaptation
         for admiration, a development of imitation, either actual or through intense attention
         to a pattern. The power of cultural products, a well-researched topic in cultural
         studies, acquires a new dimension when the reception of cultural and literary products
         is analyzed not just in the context of social forces, but when these »ideology transfers«
         are viewed in the broader perspective of evolved learning mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The second part of the volume is dedicated to »Affective Narratology«. Focusing on
         twelfth-century narrative literature, Donald Wehrs draws on the evolved capacity for
         empathy to distinguish between in-group identification as an adaptation mechanism
         with obvious advantages for the subject, and the opposite unlikely identification
         with out-groups as expression of ethical concern. Sociocultural forces may modulate
         the capacity of co-experiencing the emotional state of another and to format this
         experience according to the interests of social groups and norms. Yet a primary form
         of empathy prevails through this social modulation: a deep form of humanism, built
         in the mirroring circuitry of human cognition. This differentiation in affective response
         is expressed in the literary text analyzed by Wehrs as a dilemma, a blend between
         shared, deeply ingrained humanity, and the historical and political constraints of
         a social order based on the exploitation of others. By enunciating such impasses,
         the literary text invites one to run the blend and with it the possibility of reflection
         of a new sociality from within the narrative worlds.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Thomas Blake takes the case of two literary works whose protagonists are two matriarchic
         figures that either represent or demonize the foundations of Andaluzian society: Galso’s
         <span style="font-style:italic">Doña Perfecta</span> and Lorca’s <span style="font-style:italic">Bernarda Alba</span>. The puzzle addressed by Blake is the high receptivity to such contradictory characters.
         Drawing on the conceptual metaphor of a nation as a family, and aware of the different
         material conditions underlying the production of the two works, Blake traces the textual
         processes by which the metaphor is explored and empathy is generated, as means for
         challenging the conceptualization of morality. This, in turn, underlies the authorial
         intentions of transforming the political future, in one case, and denouncing the reality
         of the political present, in the other.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In his text, Patrick Colm Hogan discusses the metaphorical conceptualization of nation
         and the narrative genres involved in the affective representation of nationalism.
         Cross-cultural prototypes, such as the prototype of family separation and reunion,
         are deployed in nationalism emplotment, triggering a revision of the concept of national
         identity, as is the case of the work he analyses, Margaret Atwood’s <span style="font-style:italic">Surfacing</span>. Hogan demonstrates how the concept of nationalism is both cognitively and emotionally
         construed, and how the structures employed in this process are relevant across cultures
         and times.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Part three of the volume is devoted to one of the key subjects of a cognitively motivated
         study of literature, namely <span style="font-style:italic">Theory of Mind</span> (ToM), the ability to infer from observed behavior of others their unobservable mental
         states. Initially developed in primatology (Premack/Woodruff 1978) to denote chimpanzees’
         capacity for deception, a feature of social cognition, the concept has proven to be
         productive in literary studies (Zunshine 2006), as literature is a symbolic representation
         of counterfactual realities and inferred states of mind. Yet the concept is also controversial,
         and has been elaborated in two strands: theory theory, the understanding of ToM as
         a tacit theory of how the mind works, either viewed as an innate capacity or acquired
         through ecological experience; and simulation theory, which claims that we activate
         our inner resources 
         <!--
                       p. -->involved in experience to represent or simulate the inner states of others, as they
         undergo similar experiences (for a closer account of simulation, see Gallese 2007).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the first text of this section, Joel Krueger proposes an alternative phenomenological
         approach to the minds of others, based on a view of bodily actions as part of mental
         phenomena and not only their expression. Viewing cognition as something that goes
         beyond one’s head has been a well-explored idea in cognitive science, in relation
         with concepts of social and extended cognition (Clark/Chalmers 1998), and sustained
         by experimental research. Kruger’s idea of a phenomenological theory of mind based
         on »direct perception« (153) offers an interesting alternative to established models
         and creates expectations as to how literature, a rather indirect mode of representation,
         bypasses this symbolic contingency to allow this direct perception of the minds of
         others. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">As Howard Mancing writes in the next paper »In reading a work of literature there
         is no direct visual perception of bodily movements and gestures« (183). He reviews
         the two main conceptions of ToM to focus on the »interaction approach« (175), a view
         that rejects the concept of theory altogether, rather claiming that embodied experience
         and sociocultural practice are the sources of knowledge needed to infer the mental
         states of others. Mancing illustrates this with the composition structure of a picaresque
         novel from the Spanish 16<sup>th</sup> century, making the case for the consideration of culture and social experience as
         key for a mind to develop the representation of other minds. After all, humans »have
         been reading each other’s minds for eons.« (184) Moreover, construing the novel with
         a relevant theory of mind, reveals more than the genre concedes: the picaresque is
         rather understood as a narrative representation of a unified mind and its workings.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Marina Grishakova takes a step back in theory of mind, by attending to the concept
         of selfhood that precedes and is involved in the representation of the Other. Focusing
         on postmodern fiction, she explores the phenomenology of nonstandard selves, and the
         role of the Other in construing the self, noting that literary representations bear
         witness to an approximation of art and psychology that may open a path for understanding
         alternate ways of perceiving reality. This article is in line with an area of research
         in cognitive science that explores a possible link between psychosis and certain forms
         of art representation (see, for instance, Burns 2007; Demjen/Semino 2015).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The final section of the book on »Theory and History of Cognitive (Literary) Studies«
         starts with a methodological problem, namely introspection and subjective report as
         possible paths for accessing subjective experience. This is indeed a much needed debate,
         after a long period of behavioristic dominance in the study of the mind, and especially
         in the present moment, where ever more sophisticated technology holds the promise
         of total cognitive transparency. Opening this section, Mark J. Bruhn proposes a cultural
         history of introspection, presenting Romantic precursors in the debate of many contemporary
         cognitive topics. Bruhn claims a place for literature as a report of cognitive experiences
         and a means for cultivating articulate introspection in a science of the mind that
         draws not only from experimental observational methods, but acknowledges as well the
         historical legacy of introspection.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Mark Collier addresses the concepts of taste and aesthetic value challenging the view
         of a cultural-historical bias and asking whether taste might be grounded in human
         nature. The issue is close to research on the science of art (see the leading work
         by Ramachandran/Hirstein 1999) and on neuroaesthetics, which seeks to find the neural
         correlates for the experience of perceived beauty (as proposed by Zeki 2009, a leading
         researcher in the field). Collier however takes a different, philosophical approach
         and draws on David Hume’s account of aesthetic evaluation as based on human nature:
         though conceding for variability driven by education and contextual 
         <!--
                       p. -->environment, such variability was seen as grounded in human nature. Focusing on literary
         studies, Collier ends by inquiring about the correlation between unity of action and
         aesthetic values of narrative. One could further ask whether empathy, which has been
         correlated with narrative (see Breithaupt 2009), mediates in this aesthetic appraisal,
         and, further, whether empathy is a precondition for aesthetic value or indeed the
         two are to be kept apart.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the epilogue, Donald Wehrs addresses anew the core issue of this volume,, namely
         whether »cognitive readings undermine historicizing modes of analysis« (243). In a
         cognitive perspective the historicity of the subject is related to its situatedness,
         which itself is the result of evolutionary history that allows for transcultural constraints
         and conditions, rather than a discursive and linguistic construction. In that sense,
         one of the directions for this cognitive historicism is to trace transcultural processes
         that operate on meaning, such as conceptual metaphor based on bodily experience, or
         transcultural patterns of affective involvement that allow for similar emotional responses
         to literary texts across space and time. The role of language in this process is constitutive.
         Arguing on the theoretical and philosophical implications of a historically informed
         cognitive literary enterprise, Wehrs acknowledges that while »we cannot just change
         the way we think« , the neurophysiological conditions of our embodied experience are
         not simply deterministic constraints to our creativity, but instead »condition its
         possibility and contextualize its significance« (249).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Taken together, the twelve essays in <span style="font-style:italic">Cognition, Literature and History</span> make a strong case for an integration of an evolutionary view of the human mind and
         cognition and a historical consideration of the mind’s elaborate products such as
         literary texts. The chapters in this volume contribute to the bridging of the gap
         between cognitive criticism and historicism, and do so in two main ways: by reviewing
         concepts from cognitive science, proposing new ones and applying them to the analysis
         of historically contextualized texts (Duff, Sinding, Easterlin, Blake, Mancing, Collier),
         or by exploring how literary and cultural products, situated in their historical context,
         may produce and enhance cognitive effects (Mellmann, Wehrs, Hogan, Krueger, Grishakova,
         Bruhn). The systematic reflection of the relation between cognition and history in
         the analysis of literature departs in each article from the consideration of a case
         study, but extends beyond it to the view shared by the papers that understanding literature
         involves considering the mental operations underlying the text, relating these operations
         to cognition at large, and situating both the text and its cognitive underpinnings
         in the historical context and cultural significance. This combination overcomes cultural
         and historical relativism in literary criticism, and bypasses the conundrum of seeing
         the literary text as a mere illustration for cognitive processes at large. The theoretical
         view of cognitive historicism proposed in this volume is an important direction for
         the research of literature as a cultural product that reflects a shared cognitive
         view of reality.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In this perspective, literary analysis has a double scope: on the one hand, it considers
         the historic situatedness of the text, the constraints of its production and reception,
         the specificity of its cultural references; on the other hand, it focuses on the traces
         of human experience that extends beyond the particularities of the story, deriving
         from historical interpretations human, existential ones. This might, for instance,
         explain why certain texts are awarded the status of canonical works: rather than their
         submission to sociopolitical construction, the timelessness of these historically
         situated works might be their resonance of long-term evolved cognitive propensity,
         which is the basis upon which transcultural experientiality is founded. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Matching textual strategies, devices and correlating them with reading effects, from
         emotional involvement to heightened attention, and how this resonates the spirit of
         a time, or instead challenges it, is the task ahead. <span style="font-style:italic">Cognition, Literature, and History</span> is an important step in this direction.

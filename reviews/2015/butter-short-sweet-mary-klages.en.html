      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Titel_Rezension">Short, but not always sweet</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">Mary Klages, <span style="font-style:italic">Key Terms in Literary Theory.</span> London: Continuum 2012. 132 pp. [Price: EUR 18,14]. ISBN: 978-0826442673.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Mary Klages’s <span style="font-style:italic">Key Terms in Literary Theory</span> is intended as a companion piece to her <span style="font-style:italic">Literary Theory: A Guide for the Perplexed</span> (2006), both of which are geared at first- or second-year students coming into touch
         with literary theory for the very first time. As she explains in the introduction,
         guides like the earlier book »don’t yield information quickly or concisely; they are
         more like textbooks you read for detailed information.« The new book, by contrast,
         is supposed to be »different. It is the one you pick up when you come across an unfamiliar
         term in another resource, and you want an understandable definition, or you encounter
         a name you don’t recognize« (1). And, indeed, Klages generally does a good job explaining
         complex concepts to newcomers to literary theory in a brief and very down-to-earth
         manner.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The book, which is only about 130 pages long, is divided into three parts. Moving
         from <span style="font-style:italic">abjection</span> to <span style="font-style:italic">value</span>, the longest part, »Key Terms and Concepts« (3–89), provides definitions of terms
         and concepts related to the most important literary theories of the twentieth and
         twenty-first centuries. As is to be expected of a book in English, there is a certain
         bias toward theories developed in the UK and the US, but continental approaches also
         figure prominently. The second part, »Major Figures« (90–117), features short biographical
         sketches of prominent figures in the field, beginning with Adorno and ending with
         Ẑiẑek. The final part, »Important Works« (118–24), does not, as one might expect,
         list works of literary theory by these figures but provides an overview of introductory
         guides, anthologies and studies of individual theorists (whose works are listed in
         the second part anyway).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Most of the definitions offered in part one are indeed short and precise. Seldom running
         longer than half a page, they offer students enough information to get a first understanding
         of the issues at stake while not burdening them with too much information. Moreover,
         Klages goes to great lengths to keep things as simple as possible. Sentences rarely
         run for more than three lines and are seldom as convoluted as they so often are in
         other books of the same type (especially those written in German). In fact, some of
         her explanations – for example, <span style="font-style:italic">archaeology of knowledge</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">anxiety of influence</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">race</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">ethnicity</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">subaltern</span> – are truly excellent, and I will definitely use them in introductory classes in
         the years to come.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Other definitions, however, are less successful. The explanation of <span style="font-style:italic">narratology</span>, for example, begins with what I consider, in this context, unnecessary information
         on Aristotle’s theory of narrative and ends with »Post-structuralist narratologists,
         such as Mikhail Bakhtin« (56). Thus, Klages does not take any recent developments
         in narrative theory into account. Moreover, she buries the crucial distinction between
         story and discourse in the middle of the one paragraph devoted to the entry and falsely
         likens this distinction to that between langue and parole. Finally, if any reader
         now decided to look up Bakhtin’s theory of dialogicity, they would be fairly confused
         because the entry on <span style="font-style:italic">dialogic</span> explicitly states that »Bakhtin was <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> a Marxist or a post-structuralist« (23; my emphasis).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->Admittedly, though, the entry on <span style="font-style:italic">narratology</span> is not typical since most definitions are stronger and problems usually occur in
         those texts where Klages devotes more than one paragraph to a concept. As a general
         tendency, the more space Klages assigns a concept (most entries are less than a page
         long but some run up to three pages), the less precise her definitions become because
         she then provides too much unnecessary information and often loses focus. Compare,
         for example, the entry on <span style="font-style:italic">deconstruction</span> (3 pages) and the immediately following one on <span style="font-style:italic">desire</span> (half a page). The first opens with the sentence, »Deconstruction begins when Jacques
         Derrida observes, in »Structure, Sign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences«
         (1966), that there is a ‘scandal’ in Lévi-Strauss’ analysis of the structure of myth
         and culture in <span style="font-style:italic">The Raw and the Cooked</span>« (18). Lots of information follows but never a precise definition of the concept,
         let alone an explanation of what words were blended in the term <span style="font-style:italic">deconstruction</span> and for what reasons. By contrast, the entry on <span style="font-style:italic">desire</span> begins with a far more abstract sentence – »Desire is a complex term in literary
         and cultural history, referring to specific concepts in psychoanalysis that have been
         adopted and modified by a number of post-structuralist theories« (21) – and then goes
         on to provide the original definition and the transformations in the sentences that
         follow.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Another problem is that some concepts are explained several times because the explanations
         are needed for related concepts. While this surely could not be completely avoided,
         cross-references (which are entirely lacking) might have eased the problem, enabling
         Klages to shorten definitions in one place or to define terms together. For instance,
         the definition of <span style="font-style:italic">monologia</span> is repeated in its entirety, albeit in slightly different words, in the entry on
         <span style="font-style:italic">dialogic</span>. Shifting the definition of the former entry to the latter and indicating this accordingly
         would have avoided the repetition and freed some space for entries on concepts that
         are unfortunately missing. While various aspects of Marxist theory are explained in
         entries of their own, the concept of class as the most central one is not.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Other concepts that, to my mind at least, would have deserved an entry are <span style="font-style:italic">space</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">femininity</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">masculinity</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">repressive state apparatuses</span> (mentioned in the entry on <span style="font-style:italic">ideological state apparatuses</span>, though) and <span style="font-style:italic">knowledge</span> (only discussed in the entry <span style="font-style:italic">power/knowledge</span> with no reference to it under »K«). Including them would have been possible if some
         of the longer entries had been abridged, if some repetitions had been eliminated and
         if some very specialized entries such as Henry Louis Gates’s concept of <span style="font-style:italic">signifyin’</span>, which is probably only relevant for scholars in African American Studies, would
         have been left out. The same goes for some concepts from structuralist linguistics
         such as <span style="font-style:italic">langue</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">parole</span>. They are of course important in accounts of the historical development of literary
         theory, but I seriously doubt that students come across them frequently in works of
         literary criticism these days and thus feel the need to look them up.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">I will keep my remarks on the other two parts of the book short, as the first part
         is surely its centerpiece. The part that lists introductory guides and characterizes
         them in a sentence or two is quite useful especially for undergraduates. But the part
         that contains biographical information appears superfluous to me, especially because
         most entries are less than ten lines long and only list dates of birth (and death)
         and the most important works without explaining what they are about. There are a couple
         of entries that are much longer which once again creates a certain imbalance particularly
         since it is not explained why these figures were singled out to receive heightened
         attention. At a time when even Wikipedia (at least the English version) features quite
         decent articles on Derrida, Foucault and other thinkers, the available space could
         have been used better, for instance, for more definitions. In sum, then, the book
         has certain weaknesses but since it is quite cheap and since many entries are really
         helpful it is a useful addition to any university library.

      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">Keith Oatley, Such Stuff as Dreams. The Psychology of Fiction. Malden, Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell
         2011. XIV, 275 p. [Price: EUR 19,30]. ISBN: 978-0-470-97457-5.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Keith Oatley is in the rare position of inhabiting two worlds, has won recognition
         both as a psychologist with a focus on emotions and as a novelist (his first novel,
         <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">The Case of Emily V.</span>, won the Commonwealth Writer’s Prize for Best First Novel in 1994). At the same time,
         he has always sought to combine these worlds: His expertise as a psychologist has
         shaped and inspired his fictional writing, and his passion for fiction has laid the
         groundwork for one of the key threads running through his academic work: understanding
         the role of emotion in fictional narrative. In <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">Such Stuff as Dreams</span> he takes his interest in bringing these two worlds together one step further: He
         transcends his previous focus on emotions<span id="Note1_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="For example: Keith Oatley, Best Laid Schemes: The Psychology of Emotion, Cambridge 1992; –, The Passionate Muse: Exploring Emotion in Stories, New Yo…" href="#Note1">[1]</a></span> and – as indicated by the subtitle <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">The Psychology of Fiction</span> – takes his readers on a <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">tour de force</span> of the different areas where psychology can provide insight into fiction and the
         ways in which we read and otherwise make use of fiction, covering such diverse topics
         as the relationship between play and fiction, the effects of reading fiction, or the
         writing of fiction. In so doing, he skilfully weaves together concepts from literary
         theory, literary examples, and findings from experimental psychology.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">He starts out (chapter 1) with the encompassing and basic question: What is fiction
         and how does it relate to the everyday world? Following a discussion of the different
         interpretations of mimesis as representation and as world-making, illustrated by drawing
         upon Shakespeare’s notion of <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">dream</span> and how this notion changes throughout Shakespeare’s work, he introduces his own
         conceptualization of fiction as simulation: »Narrative stories are simulations that
         run not on computers but on minds« (17). This conceptualization that was first introduced
         in <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">Best Laid Schemes</span><span id="Note2_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="See footnote 1." href="#Note2">[2]</a></span> then becomes the core of Oatley’s psychology of fiction as it is developed in the
         following chapters:
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext">If we take on the idea of mimesis as world-creating alongside its meaning as world-reflecting,
         our idea of what we do as readers or audience members can change. In this case, we
         don’t just respond to fiction (as might be implied by the idea of reader response),
         or receive it (as might be implied by reception studies), or appreciate it (as in
         art appreciation), or seek its correct interpretation (as seems sometimes to be suggested
         by the New Critics). We create our own version of the piece of fiction, our own dream,
         our own enactment.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext">(18)</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Oatley’s conceptualization of the active, constructive and creative reader (a key
         concept to be developed further in the subsequent chapters) and his notion of the
         effects of fiction are thus based on the metaphor of fiction as a simulation running
         on the mind of the reader. The metaphor is further substantiated by drawing on the
         concept of mirror neurones in the brain – neurones that become active not only when
         we perform an action, but also when we see others performing that same action or,
         as recent research has shown, when we read about someone performing that action (cf.
         19f.). There is evidence, Oatley argues, that a network of interrelated brain regions
         are involved in functions such as perspective taking, imaginative thinking, and in
         story comprehension. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In chapter 2, Oatley examines the relationship between childhood play, especially
         pretence play, and fiction. Relevant concepts include, for example, metaphor and metonymy,
         which are 
         <!--
                       p. -->presented as fundamental operations of the mind, mental models, transitional objects,
         social intelligence, and theory-of-mind. Together, these concepts and the research
         surrounding them provide different facets of the overarching and well-substantiated
         argument that many of the cognitive operations and functions that form the basis of
         reading and understanding fiction are acquired in the context of childhood play. Oatley
         also makes a case for evolutionary readings of both play and art, arguing that both
         have evolved and persisted because they are adaptive and thus of advantage to the
         human species. Overall, this is a highly diverse chapter, providing a very broad overview
         of some of the pertinent concepts and research linking childhood play and fiction.
         At the same time, the exact relationship between these various concepts is not always
         clear. This applies in particular to the evolutionary perspective which might be considered
         yet a different facet of the psychology of fiction, warranting its own chapter and
         connected to the relationship between fiction and childhood play mostly by an association
         of <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">beginnings</span> in both ontogenesis and phylogenesis.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Oatley now moves on to what happens when we read fiction, when we run that simulation
         provided by an author on our own minds, and he does so by drawing on yet another characteristic
         that links reading fiction to childhood play: creativity (chapter 3). Here, the core
         argument is that in reading and understanding fiction readers are involved in a creative
         act, in making the story their own, generating their own understanding of the story
         based on the background of their individual memories, thoughts, and emotions. To substantiate
         this argument, Oatley draws on, for example, Iser’s theory of the implied reader (cf.
         72f.), the Formalist distinction between ›fabula‹ and ›syuzhet‹ (story and plot; cf.
         68ff.), to which ›dhvani‹ is added, the suggestion structure (cf. 71f.), and a number
         of studies from both cognitive psychology and reception research. From a psychological
         perspective, a classic study by Frederic Bartlett is described, demonstrating how
         the recipients of an indigenous story in the re-telling increasingly assimilated it
         to their own schema of what a story should be and entail. From the angle of (literary)
         reception studies, another classic study was conducted by Richards, where he collected
         students’ responses to 13 poems. Unlike Richards, who considered many of the – especially
         negative – responses to the poems as evidence of the students lacking in understanding
         of the true meaning of the poetry, Oatley argues in line with reader response theory
         that the students’ comments are a reflection of their effort to engage with the poems
         and make them their own, resulting in a potential multitude of different understandings
         (58). Drawing on Barthes, Oatley further posits that this potential multitude of meanings
         is in fact supported and encouraged by the simultaneity of the different codes carried
         by a given literary text (62f.). Further evidence of readers’ creativity and of how
         they make use of both textual offers such as foregrounding and their own memories
         and emotions in creating individual understandings of literary texts are presented.
         
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Overall, chapter 3 again impresses by the large variety of concepts and materials
         that are brought to bear upon the topic. At the same time, the notion of creativity
         may be stretched somewhat too thin here.<span id="Note3_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="In the first place, the use of the term ›creativity‹ in this context raises the question how creativity is conceptualized. Presumably this use of the…" href="#Note3">[3]</a></span> Moreover, one might argue that what is subsumed here under creative thought might
         be just as well or better described as an example of cognitive constructivism – a
         key concept in present-day cognitive psychology, referring to the interaction between
         top-down and bottom-up processing in thinking and (textual) understanding: how, for
         example as readers, we bring together our own previous knowledge, memories and emotions
         on the one hand and what is offered in a text on the other hand. This concept of cognitive
         constructivism, however, is unfortunately absent from the chapter and in fact the
         entire book.<span id="Note4_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Oatley presents a detailed account of some of the groundbreaking studies that have shaped cognitive constructivism, notably Bartlett’s study on reme…" href="#Note4">[4]</a></span> One might argue here that cognitive constructivism is well-suited to describe what
         happens when we engage with factual material, but falls short of covering what happens
         when we engage with fiction. Research has indeed shown that we read fiction differently
         from factual texts, that the inferences we draw based on fictional texts are more
         elaborate, more <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">polyvalent</span>, and contain more metatextual references than those drawn based on factual texts.<span id="Note5_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Helmut Hauptmeier/Dietrich Meutsch/Reinhold Viehoff, Literary Understanding from an Empirical Point of View (LUMIS Schriften 14), Siegen 1987." href="#Note5">[5]</a></span> But is this a difference in 
         <!--
                       p. -->quality that justifies labelling the one type of thought process as creative, but
         not the other – or is it a matter of degree?
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In a next step, the book moves on to some of the ›key ingredients‹ of fiction: character
         and plot. Again, Oatley succeeds at integrating concepts and theories from literary
         studies and psychology so as to mutually elucidate each other. The notion of character,
         for example, is discussed in the context of mental models, increasing our understanding
         of how fictional characters are cognitively represented, drawing attention to how
         we engage with characters or entire books, how we may indeed even become attached
         to them. Attachment to fictional characters has so far been little discussed in the
         psychology of literature, although it has received much attention in media psychology,
         both conceptually and empirically, under the heading of ›parasocial relationships‹
         and ›parasocial interactions‹.<span id="Note6_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="For an overview cf.: David Giles, Parasocial Interaction: A Review of the Literature and a Model for Future Research, Media Psychology 4, 279–305." href="#Note6">[6]</a></span> In future research it would be well worth integrating Oatley’s considerations of
         the phenomenon with existing theories and findings from media psychology on how parasocial
         relationships to both liked and disliked characters are formed and maintained.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The topic of attachment provides for a seamless transition to a chapter on emotion
         which – not surprisingly, considering Oatley’s outstanding expertise in this field
         – is easily the most advanced and conceptually elaborated chapter in the book. Here
         Oatley goes back to the assumption of fiction as a simulation running on minds and
         takes up again the notion of mirror neurones introduced in the first chapter. This
         is the starting point for a tour of the various emotions that have been discussed
         in the context of literary reading, including familiar ones such as empathy, identification,
         sympathy, as well as the lesser-known concept of the ›rasas‹ (cf. 120ff.), emotions
         based on our memories that have the potential to re-experience events from our lives
         in new and potentially self-transforming ways.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">While a fair amount has been written on the psychology of reading fiction, the processes
         and devices of writing fiction have only rarely been explored from a psychological
         perspective. This is where Oatley now turns (chapter 6), and it is one of the great
         merits of the book that it brings together these diverse facets of the field. Based
         on Tom Wolfe’s conceptualization of new journalism (136), Oatley first identifies
         and discusses four key devices of writing fiction which, he argues, allow the reader
         to construct a mental model which can then serve as that simulation that runs on minds:
         scene-by-scene construction, dialogue, point-of-view, and status life. This is followed
         by an overview of empirical studies of writing, resulting in a conceptualization of
         writing as problem solving that rests on an interplay of expertise and different kinds
         of knowledge and use of memory functions. The chapter concludes with an illustration
         of the writing process drawing on Flaubert, both his theory and his practice of writing.
         The chapter thus touches upon different aspects of writing fiction by drawing upon
         both the assumptions and concepts of literary writers themselves and on the small
         but growing body of empirical research on the topic. In addition, it would have been
         interesting to know why the theories and assumptions of those particular writers were
         chosen and how other writers’ assumptions about writing fiction fit in with Oatley’s
         model of fiction as a simulation that runs on the mind. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In a next step, Oatley returns to the reader and to the comprehensive topic of the
         effects of fiction (chapter 7) that he already touched upon in chapter 3, discussing
         the creativity of the reader, and in chapter 5, when focusing on the reader’s emotions.
         To begin with, several empirical studies are described that support the assumption
         that reading fiction increases social intelligence, such as understanding of others
         or understanding of relationships, and can serve as a vehicle for self-improvement.
         Indeed, Oatley even goes one step further and argues, based on the argument made by
         Lynn Hunt, that fiction has positively influenced the establishment of human rights
         (168). He then turns to ›transportation‹, a concept developed by Richard Gerrig to
         capture the extent to which a piece of fiction transports us to a different world,
         as a factor 
         <!--
                       p. -->that mediates the effects of fiction, such as the extent to which we are prepared
         to believe the information we read.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Again, Oatley provides a wide-ranging overview of the many diverse aspects of the
         effects of fiction. But because the effects of reading fiction can be so manifold,
         structuring of the topic along conceptual lines would have been useful. A helpful
         distinction in this context refers to the difference between the reception of a text
         and its subsequent effects, where reception relates to the reception process itself
         (here: the actual process of reading) and where effects refer to consequences that
         set in at a later point in time.<span id="Note7_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Here and in the following: Norbert Groeben/Peter Vorderer, Leserpsychologie: Lesemotivation – Lektürewirkung, Münster 1988." href="#Note7">[7]</a></span> Transportation, for example, refers to the reception process, as do the inferences
         we make during reading, whereas changes in the way we perceive ourselves would be
         an example of later-time effects. In analogy to the persuasive effects of reading
         non-fiction, effects can be further subdivided into emotional, cognitive, and conative
         effects, i.e. effects on the way we act. Changes in our belief system, for example,
         would count among cognitive effects, whereas joining a nationalist movement following
         the frequent reading of certain story themes would go one step further, with reading
         fiction having an effect on how we act in the world. Finally, effects can occur on
         the individual level, as when we gain a better understanding of ourselves as a result
         of reading fiction, or on the social level, as in long-term changes of the human rights
         legislature.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Effects of fiction that transcend the individual and take place on an overindividual
         or group level are at the centre of the final chapter of the book (chapter 8), with
         a focus on communicating about fiction. Oatley makes a distinction here between the
         interpretation of texts in literary criticism and the interpretation of texts by ordinary
         readers, arguing with Bill Benzon that the interpretation by other readers allow us
         to assess »how texts work in the mind and brain« (185). In discussing fiction with
         others, we do not only compare ourselves and our life worlds to the characters and
         their life worlds in the fictional context, but we moreover compare our understandings
         of those texts and how they relate to our everyday lives to those of others. This
         entails an – in line with reader response theory and a very deliberate – move away
         from the concept of the one correct interpretation to the acceptance of a variety
         of interpretations.<span id="Note8_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="In this, Oatley does not explicitly discuss criteria for comparing and potentially evaluating differing interpretations of the same text. It is only…" href="#Note8">[8]</a></span> To substantiate his claim, Oatley draws on empirical studies of reading groups, his
         own experience of being a reading group member, and a number of social initiatives
         making use of reading groups, such as »Changing Lives through Literature«, or »Changing
         Lives through Literature for All of Us«.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span class="pdf_RezJLT_Buchtitel_in_Haupttext_Zchn">Such Stuff as Dreams</span> is a remarkable book in several ways. It stands out by the breadth of the topics
         covered, extending beyond the reader to also include the writing and the communication
         about fiction, and by the diversity and richness of the many different concepts and
         studies brought to bear upon the topic. Throughout the book, Oatley never loses his
         footing as the inhabitant of the twin worlds of literature and of academe, both in
         the concepts he draws upon and in his writing where he takes the reader along on a
         journey to the different areas that make up the psychology of fiction. As a result,
         the book has much to offer to different kinds of readers: The academic from Literary
         Studies will learn much about the current state of empirical studies in psychology
         that substantiate many of the claims that have been made of the positive effects of
         fiction. The academic from Psychology will learn about the literary grounding and
         analogies of many of the concepts used in empirically studying the reading of fiction.
         And the interested layperson will find the writing easily accessible and will gain
         a broad overview of fiction, its various aspects and effects.<span id="Note9_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="It should also be noted that Keith Oatley’s book is to be seen within the tradition of the psychology of literature, elaborated most prominently by N…" href="#Note9">[9]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">At the same time, the main strength of the book, namely the breadth and diversity
         of the topics that are covered here, are also closely related to what may be considered
         its main drawback: Among the multiplicity of concepts and research available in the
         field, the reason for selecting some for inclusion and not others does not become
         sufficiently clear. This concerns in particular 
         <!--
                       p. -->the rich body of research summarized under the heading of the empirical study of literature.
         Some relevant studies are mentioned, such as van Peer’s research on foregrounding
         (74ff.), Hakemulder’s study on the effects of reading fiction on attitudes towards
         minority groups (172f.), or the work of Green and collaborators on the role of transportation
         in mediating the cognitive effects of fiction (172). But Oatley does not refer to
         the research tradition as such. This strikes me as a notable omission, considering
         that the field has yielded both theoretical conceptualisations of the process of reading
         literary texts, such as the theories put forward by Norbert Groeben and by Siegfried
         Schmidt, and a large number of empirical studies, emphasizing the constructive processes
         on the reader’s side as well as investigating the interaction between specific textual
         features and text comprehension.<span id="Note10_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="For example: Norbert Groeben, Rezeptionsforschung als empirische Literaturwissenschaft: Paradigma- durch Methodendiskussion, Athenäum 1977; –, From T…" href="#Note10">[10]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">It would also be helpful to see the diversity of concepts integrated to a larger extent.
         The effects of reading fiction on empathy and social understanding, for example, are
         discussed in chapters 2, 7, and 8 – but how do these different facets of the topic
         relate to each other? And how exactly are character, action, and incident (chapter
         4) taken up again in writing fiction (chapter 6)? Finally, I at times found myself
         wondering about the type of fiction to which Oatley’s observations apply. He occasionally
         mentions genre and that some genres are more limiting than others (cf. 62), but he
         does not go into detail here. Some assumptions seem to apply to all fiction, regardless
         of genre, such as the conceptualization of fiction as a simulation that runs on minds.
         Other assumptions, such as the potential of reading fiction for self-improvement,
         seem limited to literary fiction with a capital L, raising the question of the boundaries
         of literature and the question of the potentially different effects of different kinds
         of writing and different genres. With <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Buchtitel_in_Haupttext_Zchn">Such Stuff as Dreams</span> Oatley lays a solid foundation for further work exploring these more specific questions
         both conceptually and empirically.

                  how creativity is conceptualized. Presumably this use of the term is situated within
                  so-called little-c models of creativity which emphasize the creative and potentially
                  transformative aspects of everyday thinking and understanding: James C. Kaufman /

               evaluating differing interpretations of the same text. It is only in passing that
               he mentions what he considers a disadvantage of much (though not all) literary criticism
               and, conversely, an advantage of bringing together different interpretations in a
               group of interested readers: “[…] in reading the critic’s piece, one is not so much
               enabled to think and feel about the text in a new way, one is being induced to vote.”

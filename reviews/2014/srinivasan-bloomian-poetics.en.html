      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">Harold Bloom, The Anatomy of Influence: Literature as a Way of Life. New Haven and

      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">What is a Bloomian reading of a literary text? Why does it matter? Why is it, for
         instance, that Bloom always begins his criticism of a literary text with the identification
         of a significant precursor poet or a predecessor text? These are some of the important
         questions on method that will come to a reader’s mind when he begins to read Harold
         Bloom’s books on literary criticism seriously. A Bloomian reading, as I go on to demonstrate
         later in this review, is mainly an expression of »literary love« (3–15) since Bloom
         has a habit of falling in love with poems and literary characters without worrying
         about the differences between reality and representation. While it is not uncommon
         for a Bloomian reading of a literary text to begin with the identification of a relevant
         precursor poet or predecessor text; a preoccupation with what came before is not synonymous
         with a Bloomian reading as such. The identification of a precursor poet or a predecessor
         text is only a methodological means to an end rather than an end in itself. The identification
         of what came before is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient condition
         to attempt a Bloomian reading of a literary text. There is a good reason for this:
         literary influence, or the anxiety of influence, for Harold Bloom, is not always a
         conscious literary transaction between poets of different generations who decide to
         be influenced, or not to be influenced by a predecessor; but, more often than not,
         an unconscious relationship between poems or literary texts that the participating
         poets (i.e. the predecessor and the ephebe) may not be fully conscious of. Literary
         critics however talk about literary transactions as though they were about conscious
         literary relationships between poets or writers that are modelled on who-learnt-what-from-whom,
         when, and why. This is because the structure of language forces us to personify these
         dynamics as though the ephebe is talking to his predecessors, or misreading them deliberately,
         in order to create space for his own work. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The literary convention of poets talking about their predecessors then is a way of
         capturing certain autonomous textual processes that they may not be fully conscious
         of, but which a literary critic – informed by the theory of influence – can reconstruct
         for readers through the invocation of Bloom’s six revisionary ratios <span style="font-style:italic">après coup</span> in the act of reading. This is however not to say that Bloom recommends his six revisionary
         ratios to all readers – or that invoking these six revisionary ratios to situate a
         text is the only thing that a literary critic can do when he writes about a poet since
         the critic must demonstrate some love for the text that he is writing about rather
         than treat it like a mere scientific specimen. The Bloomian revisionary ratios, like
         the identification of the relevant predecessor, constitute a technical vocabulary
         that is specific to Bloom’s critical idiolect; it may or not be useful for all readers
         who attempt to do literary criticism if they don’t experience the passion that Bloom
         does. It is also a matter of transferential affinity to the Bloomian persona of the
         solitary reader that will help readers decide whether or not they will deploy these
         six revisionary ratios when they read and write about poems. I do not attempt to situate
         Bloom within a particular school of thought, or school of literary criticism in this
         book review, because that is precisely what Bloom has himself dedicated his career
         to not doing. The main grouse that Bloom has had against literary forms of deconstruction
         is the fact that it becomes a predictable form of critical discourse. So, whether
         a literary critic deconstructs a text, or a text deconstructs itself, and a literary
         critic merely notices that it does so; it becomes, 
         <!--
                       p. -->or can be construed as becoming, a form of endless critical repetition without adequate
         passion to animate the reader. The practice of solitary reading, as Bloom understands
         it, is not merely to tell somebody else how they must read a literary text, but to
         also embody an ethic of why they should bother to read at all in this day and age.
         It would therefore be incorrect to pretend that the usefulness of such an ethic can
         be lexicalized as a disembodied approach to literary criticism or as an academic discourse.
         Or, to put it more directly, Bloom is not trying to be a systematic thinker like a
         semiotician though he returns to his favorite themes, like the <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">agon</span> and the anxiety of influence, in book after book.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Another way of putting this idea across is to say that while the Bloomian ratios can
         be invoked within a semiotic approach to literary criticism, that is clearly not Bloom’s
         authorial intention. Bloom’s approach to reading and writing is to resist precisely
         those forms of lexical appropriation that can be construed as ›reductive‹ within semiotics
         and attempt something that is more akin to a Bloomian poetics. There is a greater
         sense of transferential embodiment, for Bloom, within a model of poetics as opposed
         to a model of semiotics. The attempt to situate Bloom as though he is just another
         literary theorist in a long list of theorists is based on a fundamental misunderstanding:
         it conflates the epistemological difference between semiotics and poetics in a theory
         of poetry. It would also violate the spirit of Bloomian poetics insofar as Bloom describes
         »literature as a way of life« in the subtitle of this book. The semiotic approach
         is more appropriate to the lexicalization of forms of representation that have a clearly
         articulated method; but it will not be able to capture the spirit of the Bloomian
         enterprise if it is defined as a way of life and as an expression of literary love.
         That is why it is important to read Bloom within the tradition of transferential genealogies
         of reading and writing rather than in terms of whatever the latest fads in literary
         criticism might be. This is a singular honor that is usually attached to certain literary
         critics of stature like Erich Auerbach, Ernst Curtius, George Steiner, and Harold
         Bloom. We do not situate them as literary critics; instead we find that they situate
         us as readers, or as students of literature, in a fundamental state of belatedness
         to their example. This is however an ethic that Bloom applies to his own reading practice
         when he reads Richard Burton on melancholia. Not surprisingly, then, Bloom even begins
         with an invocation of Burton’s <span style="font-style:italic">Anatomy of Melancholy</span> as the relevant predecessor text since the object of influence here is the literary
         melancholia of the solitary reader and solitary writer. Bloom’s intention is to identify
         the role that literary melancholia plays as a form of literary influence. I must however
         hasten to add that while Bloom identifies Burton as an important predecessor, the
         goal of this book is not to produce a reading of Burton <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">per se</span>. It is of course worth asking why Bloom doesn’t actually begin this book with a reading
         of Burton’s meditations on melancholy; Bloom on Burton is the <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">unrealized</span> element of this book; its textual unconscious, as Lacanian psychoanalysts might put
         it. Is that because Bloom refuses to take Burton’s admonition on the solitary life
         seriously? Is it not Bloom’s wager <span style="font-style:italic">contra</span> Burton to take the ethic of the solitary life forward despite the dangers involved
         in doing so? Taking Burton too seriously then would lead to a performative contradiction;
         but, nonetheless, Burton’s melancholia symbolizes Bloom’s existential predicament
         of being a solitary reader in a way that is compelling enough to serve as a predecessor
         for readers who come in his wake.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">What is the aim of literary criticism in the Bloomian theory of reading? This is where
         Bloom will take his readers by surprise. Bloom does not read to deconstruct or reconstruct
         as literary theorists usually do, but to express his notion of literary love. In Bloom’s
         case, it would not be inappropriate to invoke the notion of reading as necessarily
         a form of re-reading since he reads a section of the literary canon year after year,
         and has taught literature at Yale for six decades. Bloom does not define literary
         criticism as a means to anything immediate, but rather as a secular pursuit of wisdom:
         it is, quite simply, a way of life, as the subtitle puts it, that prizes individuality
         of thought and expression. It is an ode to the solitary reader. This is a theme that
         Bloom returns to repeatedly; it is one of the main <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">motifs</span> in his ethic of reading. This ethic is 
         <!--
                       p. -->stated as an individual norm and Bloom does not consider whether it will be widely
         shared in the future. And, again, Bloom does not consider what, if anything, literary
         critics can do to widen the ambit of serious readership in the future. What he does
         instead is to redefine solitary reading as the pursuit of wisdom in a world where
         there is a huge preoccupation with data and information. What is at stake in these
         solitary pursuits is the very definition of the term literary, which is just another
         term for the canonical lists of texts that will endure the test of time. These literary
         relationships take the form of an <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">agon</span> (i.e. conflict) between the ephebe and the predecessor. These literary dynamics are
         not only constitutive of the structure of the literary text, but help us to understand
         a large number of contemporary discourses since what is at stake is the problem of
         creative misreading through which a strong writer tries to clear space for his own
         work.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">There are four parts to this book. The first part sets out Bloom’s point of view as
         a literary critic. The main preoccupation in this part is with the themes of literary
         love, the quest for strangeness in the reading and writing of literary texts, and
         on the dynamics of literary influence. The notion of love is important for Bloom since
         he is critical of the notion of affective fallacy, which forbids a literary critic
         from factoring in his emotions while interpreting a literary text. One of the fall-outs
         of this fallacy is that it left no room for the sublime in literary interpretation.
         Bloom’s preoccupation with Longinus is related to the prefiguration of the Freudian
         problem of the uncanny in the notion of the sublime; which, incidentally, is not reducible
         to the beautiful. In addition to Longinus’s take on the sublime, another crucial predecessor
         for Bloom’s theory of poetry is the Roman poet Lucretius; whose notion of the swerve
         in his Epicurean theory of atomic behavior has proved to be of great importance in
         both poetry and psychoanalysis, since it has implications for not only a theory of
         free will but also for theories of the subject. The swerve is that which serves to
         limit the scope of physical determinism; and, by implication, psychic determinism,
         within theories of subjectivity. So, when atoms fall, they don’t fall mechanically
         (making it easy to calculate their trajectories) but rather as probabilities. What
         is at stake here is the difference between a mechanical trajectory and the path of
         a subjective probability. When the poet swerves, it is hard to say what will happen.
         The new path that emerges is the object then of poetic consciousness. If every fall
         were mechanical, there would be no possibility of either poetic consciousness or poetic
         representation in the poet’s mind. When more than one poet takes up the challenge
         of representing the fall, the latter-day poet will have to wrestle with a notion of
         strangeness to fall in a way that is significantly different from his predecessor.
         It is not enough to merely swerve, but to swerve in a way that is significantly better
         than the predecessor. The goal of the literary <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">agon</span> is to make the predecessor appear as not having swerved adequately enough compared
         to the sense of daring with which the ephebe swerves in his turn. The ephebe thereby
         fulfills the unrealized potential in his predecessor. This is quite simply the mechanism
         that constitutes the topology of literary influence. While Bloom states this model
         to be of specific interest to the history of post-Miltonic poetry, it is not difficult
         to understand that a number of additional discourses can also come under its scope.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In poetry, then, the main preoccupation is with the notion of the fall from an earlier
         state of Grace as the necessary prelude to a theory of eschatology. Both the thematic
         concerns and the functional goals of poetry, its basic Aristotelian <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">telos</span>, are related to either the theological or secular representations of this eschatology.
         The fall is the narrative mechanism that gets the text started in the Judeo-Christian
         tradition and revolves around the myth of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. However,
         what is really at stake in this myth is not the fall from a higher to a lower strata
         of society, or matter as such, but the trajectory of the swerve in which the poet
         falls, or represents his protagonist as falling (as John Milton knew well in his depiction
         of Satan in <span style="font-style:italic">Paradise Lost</span>). Satan repeats the fall of Adam, but swerves in a way that is much more interesting
         for a poet who is observing or constructing the trajectory. It is again the Lucretian
         swerve that is in contention in the Freudian notion of the death instinct. The Freudian
         analogue 
         <!--
                       p. -->of the fall is the desire of the organism to eventually return to an inorganic state
         of matter – to once again return to the basic elements of the physical world as an
         entropic dissolution; what is true for the organism is true for the poet as well.
         Since most of the poets whom Bloom finds engaging in both the Anglo-American and European
         traditions are Lucretian by intention and temperament, it is important for him to
         assert strongly the relationship between strangeness and the anxiety of influence.
         Strangeness becomes a prerequisite in the literary tradition for the expansion or
         the Bloomian augmentation of consciousness that only great writers can achieve. In
         the absence of the literary trope of strangeness, all representations of the fall
         would be identical, and there would be no means available to determine which, if any,
         are worthy of the sublime; that is why, as Bloom points out, strangeness »is <span style="font-style:italic">the</span> canonical quality, the mark of sublime literature« (19).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This is an argument that is not only specific to this book, but one which Bloom had
         taken up earlier: the aesthetic function of poetry and the literary mechanisms needed
         to facilitate it in the form of textual constructs are interlinked in his theory of
         reading. We must however not conflate Longinus with Lucretius: the former is preoccupied
         with the notion of the sublime as a form of lifting to a higher order and the latter
         with the swerve as a form of falling to a lower order. Longinus is preoccupied with
         the internal world of language; Lucretius is trying to describe the external world
         of atomic physics. These poets are important for Bloom because they constitute the
         basic typology of literary possibilities: the ephebe’s basic complaint is precisely
         that these predecessors not only represent, but exhaust the typology of both that
         which is higher and that which is lower; hence the anxiety of influence is the operative
         trope within the locus of belatedness in which the latter-day poets find themselves.
         These poets do not represent archaic theories: they are probably those who really
         understand what it means to embody a theory of literature within a genealogy of the
         Lucretian swerve. Latter-day theories of literature suffer precisely insofar as they
         are not able to improve adequately upon these predecessors. To term these theories
         archaic is to misunderstand the function of the predecessor text in Bloomian poetics.
         For Bloom, what current literary theory does is to merely annotate the typological
         possibilities inherent in the predecessors who really matter without necessarily improving
         upon their work. So, for Bloom, the Lucretian swerve is not just another trope of
         literary figuration that has outlived its usefulness; it is, on the contrary, the
         very prototype of the fall in the Judeo-Christian tradition. It becomes prototypical
         not only because it is featured in Milton and the ancient poets, but also because
         the prototypical rendition of the swerve in the atomic physics of Lucretius is articulated
         as a poem, a series of tropes, in an era when there was no formal distinction in the
         history of ideas between a poet and a physicist. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The second part of the book is an attempt to up the <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">ante</span> of the swerve in the history of poetry by moving backwards from John Milton to William
         Shakespeare as ›the‹ locus of the influential predecessor in the history of early
         modern literature. This is something that Bloom did not have the time to do earlier
         when he first broached the topic of the anxiety of influence. Bloom now sets out to
         explain why Shakespeare is an important predecessor in as many as five to six chapters
         of this book. The themes that he touches upon include the sheer proliferation of major
         and minor characters in Shakespeare (which, incidentally, is so realistic in its depiction
         that it spawned the character is destiny school of literary analysis); rivalries between
         Shakespeare and his own lead characters (like Lear, Prospero, and Hamlet despite the
         fact that they don’t belong to the same ontological realm), in terms of their unusual
         ability to augment our consciousness as readers; and, finally, in articulating the
         modes of subjective possession in the sonnets. Bloom doesn’t believe that it is possible
         to read or reread Shakespeare in a way that will completely subsume the ontological
         residues of the poet’s persona in the sonnets or elsewhere even if we don’t know who
         Shakespeare really was as a figure in empirical history. It is not Shakespeare’s readers
         who analyze these phenomena objectively: what we find instead is that their augmented
         consciousness is coeval with the forms of subjectivity thrown up by the Shakespearean
         text in 
         <!--
                       p. -->acts of literary interpretation. That is why Bloom is fond of pointing out that what
         is required is not another Freudian reading of Shakespeare, but rather a Shakespearean
         reading of Freud as a theoretical corrective in order to ensure that there is greater
         methodological reciprocity between psychoanalysis and literature in literary criticism.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The third source of influence on Bloomian poetics after Longinus and Lucretius is
         Epicurus. Before setting out why Bloom is interested in Epicurus, it is important
         to differentiate between Longinus and Kant on the sublime. Occasional readers of Bloom
         may not realize his preoccupation with ancient poetics and may situate him incorrectly
         with better known Kantian themes in English and American romantic poetry. The Greek
         term that is associated with Longinus on the sublime is <span style="font-style:italic">ekstasis</span>: it represents a literary mode of transporting the reader to a higher level of consciousness
         through transcendental forms of literary invocation. The Kantian sublime however pertains
         to the external world. Bloom encounters Epicurus through a text by Walter Pater that
         is entitled <span style="font-style:italic">Marius the Epicurean</span>. I will develop the relationship between Lucretius and Epicurus in the next section
         as a way of leading into Bloom’s readings of American literature, but suffice it to
         note at this juncture that the Lucretian model of the swerve is derived from the atomic
         theories of Epicurus; the ancient Bloomian triumvirate then is Longinus, Lucretius,
         and Epicurus. To make sense of the third and fourth parts of this book, we must understand
         why Epicurus is so important for Bloom. The third part explores the »skeptical sublime«
         (131–206), while the fourth part is a collection of readings of mainly American poets
         (and one English poet D.H. Lawrence) who take further the Lucretian swerve in an Epicurean
         direction. Unlike the texts in the first two parts, the poets included in the last
         two parts are not as fully canonized on both sides of the Atlantic. It is therefore
         a lot more difficult to make sense of them as working-through anxieties of Epicurean
         influence; especially if readers don’t differentiate rigorously between Longinus,
         Lucretius, and Epicurus or fail to appreciate the fact that the atomic theory of the
         ancients can provide an important theoretical analogue for poets who are our near
         contemporaries. A note on the Epicurean element, the Epicurean swerve, might help
         readers through the more difficult parts of this book. The Epicurean critic, Bloom
         observes, works mainly with three modes; they are sensations, perceptions, and feelings;
         this is an aesthetic that he associates most powerfully with Walter Pater and Oscar
         Wilde in the Victorian era. The main Epicurean intervention in a theory of the Lucretian
         swerve is to ensure that there is room for free will in a theory of the subject. Neither
         physical determinism nor psychic determinism is what we think it to be. The swerve
         may be only random and slight, but everything in the inner world and outer world depends
         on it. What did Epicurus want? Bloom points out that he wanted »absolute non-determination
         and ethical choice« – hence the unwilled swerve. Epicurean freedom then is a form
         of »sublime indifference« that can be termed <span style="font-style:italic">ataraxia</span>; it renders the subject »immune from anxieties and irrational fears«, when it considers
         its own eventual dissolution into nothingness (142).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">What the fourth part of the book does is to place the poet himself in the locus of
         the Lucretian subject. It then asks a more difficult question (given the Bloomian
         contention that a poem is a form of achieved anxiety): »Can you be a Lucretian poet
         without being an Epicurean?« (143). Another way of putting this question is to ask:
         Can the fall that constitutes the Lucretian swerve be secular in its trajectory? Or,
         will it seek recourse to some form of religious consolation? The Bloomian readings
         in the third and fourth part of the book wrestle mainly with existential questions
         like this. Many readers, including Bloom himself, might answer no to the questions
         given above; but this is possible in some exemplary cases. Bloom himself cites Percy
         Shelley, Walt Whitman, and Wallace Stevens as the best instances of the skeptical
         sublime that will not seek recourse to forms of religious consolation in the history
         of poetry. While there is not sufficient space to summarize all the Bloomian readings
         on the Epicurean inflection of the Lucretian swerve in this review, I conclude by
         asking what, if any, was the achieved anxiety that Lucretius himself experienced in
         relation to Epicurus? Are we Lucretian readers precisely 
         <!--
                       p. -->because Lucretius himself did not experience an anxiety of influence in his transference
         to Epicurus? Or was it rather the case that Lucretius could work-through the need
         to hold fast to the topological structure of the swerve without expecting it to be
         anything more than a tilt in its trajectory? The need for religious consolation itself
         can then be understood (as opposed to literature as a way of life) as the inability
         of the poet to manage his own existential expectations or represent them as adequate
         figures in a poem. This is, however, not to say that the poet is necessarily conscious
         of what he is doing, or can necessarily explain his aesthetic rationale, to a literary
         theorist when he decides that religious consolation is more important than exploring
         the topology of the swerve as an aesthetic end in itself. Most of these processes
         are however unconscious transactions between poets; they are forms of figurations
         that mediate their transference to a precursor poet or a predecessor text. What Bloomian
         poetics does then is to set out a formal theory of revisionary ratios that will help
         readers to make sense of the formations of the poet’s unconscious within a theory
         of poetry. This book will be of great interest to those working on the history of
         literature, theories of poetics, and for those literary theorists who want to understand
         the relationship between literature and psychoanalysis. It is based on the fundamental
         assumption that the doctrines of Longinus, Epicurus, and Lucretius cannot be reduced
         to a mere collection of ideas that we can agree or disagree with. They constitute
         fundamental tendencies within not only the history of ancient atomism; but, more importantly,
         for poets, the very history of figuration. The Lucretian swerve embodies then, to
         conclude, the moment of epistemological continuity between the topological structure
         of the swerve and its tropological representation in the history of Bloomian poetics.

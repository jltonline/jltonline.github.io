      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Titel_Rezension">Review of: Line Brandt, The Communicative Mind</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">Line Brandt, The Communicative Mind: A Linguistic Exploration of Conceptual Integration
         and Meaning Construction. 636 p. Newcastle-upon-Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing
         2013. [Price: £69.99]. ISBN 978-1-4438-4144-3.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This is a significant book. It begins by making a claim for an interdisciplinary collision
         of linguistics (especially semantics and pragmatics), literary studies, neurophenomenology,
         cognitive psychology, philosophy and sociology. It draws on fiction, poetry, everyday
         discourse; metaphor, iconicity and readerly effects; rhetoric, grammatical description,
         and a historical range of thinking about language. The result is an assertion that
         all of these related dimensions can be resolved into a single over-arching discipline:
         that of cognitive semiotics. This is an ambitious project, but over 600 pages of surprisingly
         readable and clear argument, it is exactly what emerges.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the beginning and central to the entire book is the concept of <span style="font-style:italic">enunciation. </span>This is a much broader unit of analysis than is typically adopted in linguistic or
         even discourse analytical studies. If an utterance is a sentence in its context of
         use, then an enunciation is an utterance in its full social, interpersonal, cultural
         and communicative context. »The study of enunciation entails systematic accounts of
         those conceptual categories shaping language, that are derived from representational
         acts of interpersonal communication, and awareness in a speaker of other subjectivities«
         (49). This summative formulation from the introductory chapter captures the sense
         that Brandt’s thinking places communication at the heart of her theoretical argument.
         And this is communication in the empirical, verifiable, partly observable sense. Though
         there is a strong philosophical, critical and abstract aspect to Brandt’s notion of
         communication, at every stage her statements are pinned down to concrete examples
         and situations.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">A false distinction has emerged in recent years, in which some discourse analysts
         have complained that cognitive scientific approaches to language have been overly
         psychological and insufficiently social and ideological. I think this perception is
         wrong, but Brandt’s positioning of communicativeness as the object of analysis refutes
         it once and for all. The choice is not between objectivity and subjectivity, but between
         those unreachable binaries and <span style="font-style:italic">intersubjectivity</span>. The approach throughout the book is on readerly effects, meaning-making, and the
         connections between articulation and mind, but the whole enterprise is accomplished
         with a keen attention to social significance and cultural meanings as well. Crucially
         the argumentation returns again and again to language in use, authentic examples,
         empirical data and real, recognisable situations of dicourse. Several core beliefs
         drive the argument (23 – 5, paraphrased):
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li class="item">semantics is shaped by experience</li>
         <li class="item">experience is inherently dynamic</li>
         <li class="item">experience cannot be reduced to physical sensations alone</li>
         <li class="item">there is no language / sensation dichotomy</li>
         <li class="item">language is conceptually structured</li>
         <li class="item">
            <!--
                       p. -->language is always dialogic and has a communicative purpose
         </li>
         <li class="item">meaning is intentional and situated</li>
         <li class="item">embodied cognition is extended to include others’ bodies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Some of these have become cognitive linguistic orthodoxy, and will be recognisable
         to anyone steeped in the key ideas of the cognitive scientific revolution; some propositions
         are more debatable, or at least require the additional glossing that Brandt provides.
         The key proposition here points to the dialogism of language: even talking to yourself
         involves a division of mental labour. Even utterances and exclamations that are apparently
         vented solipsistically into the air have been designed and uttered within the inescapably
         dialogic texture of language. Even failed communication has communicativeness as a
         necessary design feature in its fabric. The value of Brandt’s positioning of these
         core propositions lies not only in the clarity of her articulation, but in their integration
         into a coherent field.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The book proper begins with an exploration of ›fictivity‹, arguing that fictional
         interaction has its primary meaning in its own articulation, rather than as a representation
         of something real and tangible. Exploring non-actuality is particularly interesting
         for me, with my own research into literary linguistics, and it seems to me entirely
         appropriate to place this in a prominent position in the book. This might not be the
         same impression for other readers, however. Yet an emphasis on fictivity allows for
         a controlled exploration of context without being distracted by truth-values or the
         »exceedingly nonsensical« (33) direction taken by the philosophy of language.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Much of the book draws on conceptual integration theory (née blending theory, and,
         before that, mental space theory) as developed by Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner.
         Brandt interrogates the approach, and refines, augments and adapts it throughout the
         book. Conceptual integration is a smart focus, partly because it is largely consistent
         with a range of approaches and features including conceptual metaphor theory, frames,
         idealized cognitive models, modalisation, conditionality, and cognitive grammar. Brandt’s
         balanced discussion of the advantages and problems in the theory is a model of clear
         thinking. Her project overall is to place the notion of enunication within conceptual
         integration theory. After all, it is enunciation itself – the very act of initiation
         – that works as a space builder, evoking some mental content for consideration (cf.
         206). 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Brandt proposes a typology of different kinds of integration, and develops the argument
         from everyday spoken and written discourse in the first half of the book, moving on
         to literary discourse largely in the second half. The book thus moves into what I
         would recognise as cognitive poetics, and addresses in turn fiction and poetry, though
         she prefers the more text-descriptive terms ›prosaic‹ and ›versified‹ enunciation.
         The analyses here are in themselves worth the price of the book. Indeed, chapters
         4 and 5 could stand alone as required reading for all literary scholars, and as a
         polemic and demonstration of the intellectual rigour of cognitive poetics. The book
         ends with the effects of poetic enunciation, in a witty riff on the »seven types of
         iconicity« (541ff.): phonetic, syntactic, linebreak, performative, rhythmic, rhetorical,
         and graphic iconicity. It should be apparent from this listing that Brandt is no respecter
         of the rank-scale, and the account is all the better for being led by the semiotic
         description of effects rather than driven by linguistic levels.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Back in the first chapter of the book, Brandt outlined the significant scholarly events
         in her life that helped to form her thinking as presented in this volume. The outline
         is autobiographical, but what emerges strongly is a list of key thinkers and researchers
         who have had an impact on 
         <!--
                       p. -->her intellectual life. It is a refreshing take on the dry business of scholarly papers:
         there is a sense here of a vibrant and intense community of thinkers influencing,
         shaping and providing material to react with and against. The book itself, in other
         words, stands as an example of a communicating mind, and its success as an act of
         communication seems to me to be evident from the first page to the last.

      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">James E. Dobson. <span style="font-style:italic">Critical Digital Humanities. The Search for a Methodology</span>. Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press 2019. 175 p. [Price: $ 25.00 (Paper)].
         ISBN: 978-0-252-08404-1
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">With <span style="font-style:italic">Critical Digital Humanities. The Search for a Methodology</span>, James E. Dobson presents a contribution to the current digital humanities debate
         about their orientation and basis in book length. His aim is to practice the digital
         humanities as critical digital humanities in the context of literary studies. Hereby
         »critical« means two things to him: On the one hand, it is about criticizing digital
         methods in the sense of an analysis and reflection of the digital humanities methodology.
         On the other hand, Dobson calls for digital humanities to be practiced as critical
         in the sense of literary criticism (cf. 3f.). Since Dobson focuses on literary criticism,
         <span style="font-style:italic">digital humanities</span> primarily stands for literary text analysis, which is implemented computationally
         with methods of corpus creation and text analysis.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Dobson outlines his project in the foreword and also mentions the central theses and
         goals of his contribution (vii-xii). He points out that computational procedures bring
         with them both new possibilities and new challenges for the humanities, and demands:
         »Neither the complications nor the opportunities necessitate outright rejection or
         unreflective acceptance« (viii). Accordingly, he will begin to examine to what extent
         the data-based and algorithm-driven approaches contribute to the »interpretative goals
         of humanities« (ibid.). In doing so, he wants to distinguish himself from the view
         that automated analysis in itself is a goal of digital humanities, which he believes
         to be widespread. In addition, Dobson criticizes approaches to literary texts that
         treat them mainly as cultural information, as well as the concept of evidence associated
         with these approaches. According to him, the »documentary realist treatment of digital
         or digitized sources« (ix) is not suitable for depicting the full range of literary
         interpretation practices. Instead, »computational criticism is a situated rather than
         an empirical and objective activity« (x), i.e., it is a matter of context-dependent
         practices.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The following chapters essentially revolve around this situatedness, with Dobson bringing
         a wealth of discourses, arguments, and examples into the field in order to elaborate
         on them. He acts both on a critical or reflective level and on the level of the implementation
         of computational text analysis. The latter comprises exemplary approaches of other
         researchers, as well as his own, in which he applies exemplarily discussed procedures
         and makes available their data and code. Dobson thus works on his topic of critical
         digital humanities on two levels, in which he to some extent combines them by discussing
         already implemented approaches with regard to their (non-)contribution to the critical
         digital humanities. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The number of research approaches discussed, together with Dobson's own approaches,
         theses and demands, and the different target groups implicitly addressed therefore
         result in a rather heterogeneous text in which the guiding threads are sometimes difficult
         to identify. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->Nevertheless, Dobson's book can be read – in some cases with great profit – from three
         perspectives that correspond to the presentation and reflection of digital humanities
         approaches at different levels: (i) as a demand for reflection and critique of computational
         text analysis from the perspective of literary criticism, (ii) as a rather introductory
         description of the basic steps in computational text analysis, and (iii) as a critique
         of exemplary implementations of computational text analysis. These levels are, of
         course, interconnected. For a differentiated review of Dobson's contribution, though,
         it is worth considering them individually.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">1. Reading 1: The Critical Digital Humanities Program</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Dobson's contribution should first of all be read as a contribution propagating a
         critical approach to digital humanities in a productive sense. This aspect is highlighted
         by the programmatic title of his book as the central argument. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">His overall aim is to establish a practice of literary criticism, which can be described
         as <span style="font-style:italic">suspicious reading</span> (according to Ricœurs <span style="font-style:italic">hermeneutics of suspicion</span>) in the digital humanities. Dobson identifies a number of important and appropriate
         aspects which in his view should play a role in the consideration and critical reflection
         of digital humanities approaches. The wealth of discourses that Dobson considers for
         this purpose cannot be reproduced here. But the most important aspects will be summarized
         cursorily.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the first chapter, Dobson discusses the consequences of digitization for text and
         text analysis.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Dobson states that digital humanities certainly stimulate the current discussion on
         approaches in the humanities. This makes it possible to come back »to a series of
         important debates concerning the protocols of reading and the task of interpretation«
         (10). In addition, computational methods would »both expand what we do and raise important
         questions that proposed alternative methods might not« (11). Thus, Dobson regards
         computational approaches as a heuristic for theory and methodology (in the sense of
         a systematic methodological reflection) of analysis and interpretation of texts. This
         is a critical view that is partly already established, but, according to Dobson, must
         be further intensified (cf. 15f.). Consequently, the specificity of digital humanities
         is not determined by their methods, but by their critical claims. The central questions
         of the critical digital humanities are accordingly: »where the output came from, what
         computational transformations were executed to produce them and why these, what influenced
         the possible uses and processes afforded by these transformations were, and where
         they came from« (20f.). 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Dobson criticizes the attitude that ›mining is not meaning‹ by pointing out that even
         a simple text mining procedure such as collocation analysis is based on a certain
         theory of meaning, namely the context theory of meaning established, among others,
         by Firth (cf. 22).<span id="Note1_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="John Rupert Firth, Papers in Linguistics: 1934 – 1951, London 1957." href="#Note1">[1]</a></span> Additionally, Dobson regards the distant reading approaches of Matthew L. Jockers,
         Franco Moretti and others as belonging to the social sciences and not to the humanities.
         In the separation of method and interpretation that is propagated in these, he sees
         an attempt to cover structuralist approaches in order to avoid poststructuralist critique
         (cf. 29). According to Dobson, the methodological core of the humanities consists
         of a humanities »metamethod« with its question »How exactly shall we justify this
         one?« as well as in their various heterogeneous methods (30). Furthermore, Dobson
         states that it is difficult to combine the methods of the humanities with the computational
         methods based on validity. Nevertheless, one should not defer the use of computational
         methods because of doubts about these methods arising from »suspicious and critical
         readings« (31).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->In the second chapter, Dobson deals with text-mining approaches as »the strongest
         form of digital humanities« (34).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Dobson agrees with Katharine Bode's demand for new digital objects that represent
         literary works appropriately in their historical context.<span id="Note2_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Katherine Bode, The Equivalence of »Close« and »Distant« Reading; Or, Toward a New Object for Data-Rich Literary History, Modern Language Quarterly 7…" href="#Note2">[2]</a></span> He mentions TEI as a possible starting point for the development of further standards,
         but does not specify these standards beyond the separation of text and paratext, which
         is already possible with TEI. In addition, Dobson argues that a formalized description
         of the computational processes involved in creating these objects is essential (cf.
         36f.). Dobson predicts a separation between open source software and Voyant-like tools
         and then proposes ›the‹ open source model as the appropriate model for the required
         transparency, whereby he equates open source with minimal computing approaches. The
         latter are suitable for approaches that are more oriented towards the extension rather
         than the replacement of critical practices in the humanities, as Dobson says referring
         to Phillip R. Polefrone et al. (38)<span id="Note3_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Phillip R. Polefrone/John Simpson/Dennis Tenen, Critical Computing in the Humanities, in: Constance Crompton/Richard J. Lane/Raymond George Siemens (…" href="#Note3">[3]</a></span>. According to Dobson, »The human-scale, minimal computing model coupled with richly
         and openly available datasets answers some of [sic] important critiques launched against
         computational methods as now used within the humanities« (ibid). He therefore considers
         minimal computing and minimal methods a way to democratize participation in digital
         humanities due to their comparably low costs (cf. 38f.).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">As a solution for publishing workflows he suggests Jupyter Notebooks (cf. 39), which
         he praises for including not only the possibility of integrating text blocks but also
         the possibility of inserting code comments (cf. 40). This is a bit puzzling: While
         Jupyter Notebooks certainly are a great way of documenting the process of analysis,
         the use of code comments is not a particular feature of them; they can be used in
         all common programming languages. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Using the example of machine learning, Dobson explains that data »cannot ever be said
         to be computed, distilled, and analyzed free of subjective intent« (43); rather, even
         unsupervised learning always reflects the researcher's decisions, since setting up
         the procedure requires many decisions, such as the selection of data and algorithms.
         The same also applies to »automated reading of the text« (45). Dobson exemplifies
         these decisions, among other things, by means of his own topic-modeling experiment
         and an application of Jockers model (cf. 50–57).<span id="Note4_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Jockers, Matthew Lee, Macroanalysis. Digital Methods and Literary History, Urbana 2013." href="#Note4">[4]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Dobson then turns to modeling in a more general sense and refers to Richard Jean So
         and his appeal to redirect criticism away from false or dirty data towards modeling,
         i.e. towards the abstraction of interesting phenomena and their testing in the computational
         application (cf. 46).<span id="Note5_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Richard Jean So, »All Models Are Wrong«, PMLA 132 (3, 2017), 668–73." href="#Note5">[5]</a></span> Dobson then discusses the <span style="font-style:italic">End of Theory</span> debate with reference to Chris Anderson.<span id="Note6_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Chris Anderson, The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete, Wired, 23 June 2008." href="#Note6">[6]</a></span> Both views — models as statistical testing grounds as proposed by So and the replacement
         of models by data and correlationalism proposed by Anderson —, however, are not profitable
         model concepts for digital humanities, since they are either too narrow or too wide.
         According to Dobson, the solution lies in the methods of the humanities, which provide
         the tools to design and test models (cf. 49).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The role of the (historical) context for text interpretation is emphasized by Dobson
         in the third chapter. There is a risk associated with current computational projects
         and digitality in general: »what might be called the fantasy of total history through
         the use of tools and methods that conceive of archives as a closed and complete source
         of knowledge, that operate on and can only address objects residing in the digital
         archive« (67). 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Dobson outlines the (literary studies) development that led from historical criticism,
         which resulted in canonization with the integration of the historical context, via
         New Criticism, which attempted to counter this canonization through decontextualization
         (according to Dobson: in 
         <!--
                       p. -->vain), to New Historicism in the 1980s, which juxtaposed literary texts with other
         contemporary texts in order to provide the anthropological »thick description« of
         Clifford Geertz (cf. 71–75).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Dobson presents the approach of Amy Earhart, who conceives archives as a possibility
         to enrich literary textual analysis with context, whereby the underlying technologies
         are not only to be understood as facilitators, but also as constructive in themselves.<span id="Note7_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Amy E. Earhart, Traces of the Old, Uses of the New: The Emergence of Digital Literary Studies. Ann Arbor 2015." href="#Note7">[7]</a></span> According to Dobson, researchers who use computational methods for text analysis
         and thereby establish or reproduce structuralist, ahistorical approaches are to be
         seen in contrast to this (cf. 76f.).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">At the same time, he demands that literary scholars should create their archives and
         collections according to the same contextualization considerations that are applied
         to digital archives. Historicist methods would not necessarily conflict with text-mining
         methods and could even complement them (cf. 79). Dobson points out that corpora are
         normally treated as ›self-enclosed bodies‹ and are examined with methods that are
         essentially text-immanent (even if, for example, the creation of stop-word lists can
         be done by using further texts, cf. 83). Secondary databases could therefore be used
         as heuristics to attribute meaning to texts in computational approaches. Dobson mentions
         lexical databases as an example of such a »text-external referential system«, as he
         calls them, following the linguistic designation of references referring to something
         outside the text (cf. 85). Although these systems interfere with their function as
         alternative systems of opinion by abstracting data sets, dictionaries, program libraries,
         etc., they point to the situatedness of all data (cf. 86).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Using examples of sentiment analysis, Dobson criticizes that the reference to text-external
         referential systems results in a one-sided historicization gesture, that »yokes text
         to context without the possibility of exchange« (97). In addition, the methods mentioned
         are based on empirical studies that have been carried out in the present or more recent
         past and thus cannot do justice to historical texts. This can be attributed to an
         uncritical attitude of computer science, which adheres to a ›documentary realism‹
         according to Dominick LaCapra and has a naïve understanding of databases as transparent
         and analysis results as facts (cf. 100).<span id="Note8_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Dominick LaCapra, Soundings in Critical Theory, Ithaca London 1989." href="#Note8">[8]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the fourth and final chapter, »The Cultural Significance of k-NN« (101–130), Dobson
         addresses the critique of algorithms, which he considers to be complementary to the
         otherwise mostly formalistic or phenomenological approaches as a cultural and historical
         critique. On the basis of the discussion of the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm,
         he aims at contributing to »algorithmic culture« or »algorithmic governmentality«
         (102).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">He argues that we should examine and understand the historicity of algorithms in order
         to understand (i) which cultural assumptions are formalized in them and (ii) how they
         generate the conditions of possibilities in our present (cf. 111). Dobson implements
         this first by outlining the genesis of Bayes’ theorem. He points out that, on the
         one hand, it is based on a subjective »prior« and, on the other hand, implies an intelligent
         cause (i.e. God) (cf. 113f.). 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">From a more general point of view he emphasizes that data with many outliers, such
         as data from the humanities, leads to poor results in the application of many algorithms
         (cf. 116f.). 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Dobson then traces the development of the NN algorithm in the context of the US military
         and the Second World War and presents the further development to the k-NN algorithm
         (cf. 121–126). Referring to Wendy Chun, Dobson criticizes that the algorithm applies
         the principle of homophilia.<span id="Note9_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Wendy Jui Kyong Chun, We’re All Living in Virtually Gated Communities and Our Real-Life Relationships Are Suffering’, Wired UK, 13 April 2017, https:…" href="#Note9">[9]</a></span> He thereby uncovers a central assumption contained in the algorithm that leads to
         the creation of homogeneous groups called ›Virtually Gated Communities‹ by Chun. According
         to Dobson, the developers of the algorithm used a pseudodemocratic language to describe
         the function of the algorithm (cf. 126). This happened at a time when neighborhoods
         were actually 
         <!--
                       p. -->segmented and homogenized. Dobson further problematizes this through MacCormick, who
         unreflectively uses k-NN to classify real neighborhoods in terms of their political
         donation behavior (cf. 127f.).<span id="Note10_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="John MacCormick, Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future - the Ingenious Ideas That Drive To, Princeton 2013." href="#Note10">[10]</a></span> Finally, Dobson points out that the supposedly democratic and the homogenizing principle
         of the algorithm continue to work in current machine learning procedures and must
         be criticized in order to understand their consequences. Thus, »[i]n claiming that
         data make decisions, scientists and others displace multiple forms of ideologically
         influenced subjectivity« (128). He then states: »Pattern recognition gives name to
         theological beliefs in algorithmic form that were deployed on behalf of those seeking
         to restore order and regularity in the twentieth century« (ibid.).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Finally, Dobson refers again to the already discussed concept of algorithmic governmentality
         by Antoinette Rouvroys and her Foucault-influenced claim that there must be »a discursive
         space in which subjects can call into question the operations of power and governmentality«
         (129).<span id="Note11_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Antoinette Rouvroy, The End(s) of Critique: Data Behaviourism versus Due Process, in: Mireille Hildebrandt/Katja de Vries (ed.), Privacy Due Process …" href="#Note11">[11]</a></span> According to Dobson, there has been a movement in the history of our algorithms,
         away from »contestable narratives of causation« and towards »profiling through correlation«
         (ibid.). Hence an understanding of this is important for both the humanities and everyday
         life. »One cannot isolate and distinguish interpretive and computational methods«
         (ibid.). The humanities are consequently important and »Critical theorists play a
         crucial role in creating alternative fields in which computational critique can flourish
         and have an uptake« (ibid.). Here, Dobson clearly points out the substantial contribution
         of the humanities: They can expand evidence, question the representativeness of data,
         provide examples of the whole range of the phenomenon studied, and question the existence
         of a natural order, in ›like belongs with like‹. »And finally, they can understand
         that classification itself is biased because while a list of samples must be finite,
         the range of possible objects is infinite« (130).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In his »Conclusion« (131–140), Dobson presents word embeddings as a helpful method
         in the context of critical digital humanities. He outlines their possible application,
         especially the alignment of the semantic spaces of one or more historical/specific
         texts to other texts, and concludes: »It may be the case that such alignment methods
         are the best materialization of the notion of deformation as computational humanists
         willfully warp imagined, constructed, and measured semantic space to other constructed
         spaces and the ever-receding horizon of futurity« (140).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Overall, Dobson’s major claim could be summarized as ›mining is meaning‹, and his
         most important demand is for scholars to explicate the whole process of computational
         text analysis. Both are crucial for a reflected approach in the digital humanities.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Yet, when it comes to a more detailed argumentation, Dobson’s understanding of computational
         aspects is in some cases somewhat confusing. For example, he discusses the bag-of-words
         model as being particularly suitable for researching culture, since it does not distinguish
         between text types (cf. 78). What remains unclear, however, is just why it should
         be the bag-of-words model that is text type-agnostic (and other common text models
         are not) as well as why this would even be an important feature. Additionally, Dobson
         partly contests the suitability of the model further below when he discusses Sentiment
         Mining and criticizes the bag-of-words model in text mining approaches for leading
         to decontextualization (cf. 95). There, Dobson seems to also include approaches as
         the discussed approach of Bing Liu. But these rely on dependency analyses and thus
         are not bag-of-words models, as they conceptualize text as consisting of more or less
         linear sentences in which every word has a defined relation to at least one other
         word of the sentence. Here, a more detailed definition of bag-of-word models would
         have been helpful. Moreover, the question of which text model is appropriate for specific
         texts or analysis tasks could have been raised and perhaps discussed to some extent.

         <!--
                       p. -->These issues become even more apparent when reading Dobson’s contribution from a less
         reflection-oriented and a more computational standpoint, which is discussed in the
         next section.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">2. Reading 2: An Introduction to Computational Text Analysis</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In his introduction, Dobson announces that the assumptions underlying most text-based
         computational approaches will be identified as core issues in the four chapters of
         his book. These are viewed in terms of activity classes: segmentation, normalization,
         classification, clustering, and modeling (cf. x). Thus, Dobson's contribution can
         also be read as a generalized representation of the computational analysis of literary
         texts. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Although these five activity classes mentioned in the preface are not explicitly taken
         up again in the four chapters or the conclusion, from a process perspective the book
         can nevertheless be read as a presentation of the following, sequential aspects of
         computational text analysis, which are also echoed in the chapter headings. After
         a brief introduction to digital humanities, Dobson begins with the question of the
         text basis and the transformations of texts in the course of digitization (Chapter
         1: »Protocols, Methods, and Workflows. Digital Ways of Reading«, 1–31) then moves
         on to the question of algorithms and text-immanent aspects of analysis (Chapter 2:
         »Can an Algorithm Be Disturbed? Machine Learning, Intrinsic Criticism, and the Digital
         Humanities«, 32–65), discusses the context dependency of texts and their analysis
         (Chapter 3: »Digital Historicism and the Historicity of Digital Texts«, 66–100) and
         subsequently addresses statistical models and in particular the k-NN algorithm (Chapter
         4: »The Cultural Significance of k-NN«, 101–130). The conclusion gives an outlook
         on the applicability of word embedding approaches in the spirit of the critical digital
         humanities (»Conclusion«, 131–140).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The reading of Dobson's contribution as an introduction to digital humanities includes,
         in addition to the general explanations and considerations of the above-mentioned
         aspects of computational text analysis, Dobson's applications of some typical digital
         humanities methods. Dobson applies the methods of collocation analysis, topic modeling,
         sentiment analysis and clustering based on the kNN algorithm to narratives from the
         North American Slave Narrative Archive from the University of North Carolina. In addition,
         he addresses the compilation of the corpus and emphasizes its relevance: by choosing
         that specific corpus, he is using an archive that has an organizational form typical
         for digital humanities. Furthermore, by viewing those specific texts, he argues, he
         is at the same time breaking open the restrictive canon of literary texts (cf. x).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">While these issues actually represent most of the computational approaches to textual
         analysis, Dobson’s book (with the exception of the introduction and Chapter 4) is
         probably not readily understood by digital humanities novices. This is partly because
         the discourses and references Dobson responds to are too numerous to provide a coherent
         overview. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In Dobson’s defense, one could argue that he himself did not suggest his book to be
         introductory reading. However, he does imply this, in the way his introduction to
         digital humanities right at the beginning is given (cf. 1–5), with his general workflow
         model (cf. 9), and his conclusion that he had »a recursive walking down of [...] the
         ›stack‹ of any workflow making use of computation« (131). Moreover, the part of his
         audience that is not necessarily proficient in digital humanities, for example scholars
         from the traditional literary criticism, depends on the fact that the computational
         procedures are explained to a certain extent in order to then be able to understand
         his criticism of these procedures. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->In addition to the sound parts, such as the already mentioned account of the history
         of the digital humanities, the explanation of Jupyter Notebooks (38–39) or machine
         learning (43–44), there are also a number of less accessible or even misleadingly
         presented aspects of computational procedures. These might cause some problems of
         comprehension for the audience or even lead them to inaccurate conclusions.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">For instance, while Dobson does refer to the importance of workflows and discusses
         their relevance (cf. 8) when introducing his general workflow, he does not describe
         his visualization further (cf. 9). Apparently, the visualization is a flowchart representation
         that is also based on the ISO standard and thus contains a series of fixed, meaningful
         symbols that Dobson uses and varies in his other workflow representations (cf. 55,
         87, 121). However, this is not explicated at any point.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Later, he presents the default values of a collocation function in the form of the
         output of the help command (cf. 23) and reveals this procedure only in a footnote:
         »This is the output produced by executing ›help(nltk.Text)‹ after importing the NLTK
         version 3.2.2 library with the python interpreter« (footnote 37, 145). The representation
         in the text might be difficult to read for someone without programming expertise.
         Moreover, the explanation in the footnote is only of limited use or even counterproductive.
         Although Dobson did introduce the natural language toolkit (NLTK) as well as Python
         in the main text, , in order to find an explanation involving these concepts helpful
         one also needs to have at least a vague idea about help functions in programming languages,
         what an interpreter and what a library is.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Similarly, in the context of Topic Modeling, Dobson specifies the numbering of the
         topics as #0 (cf. 50–52). While it is true that the programming language Python used
         by Dobson, just like other programming languages, assigns the first position of any
         sequence as position 0, there is no reason to adopt this enumeration system in the
         context of an otherwise barely technical representation in human communication such
         as this book.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The most blatant of these rather user-unfriendly depictions concerns the display of
         the default stopword list in the Natural Language Toolkit. Instead of simply listing
         the words, a screenshot of a Jupyter Notebook is tacitly inserted (Figure 2.3, p.
         53). As a consequence, the figure contains double-framed information (Python call,
         Jupyter Notebook) which is not made explicit. Moreover, there is no discernible reason
         or added value to this type of framing, making it likely to lead to confusion.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Here, the obfuscation which Dobson rightly criticizes in existing tools and algorithms
         is performed by Dobson himself. All these cases are unnecessary displays of programming
         aspects, which do not contribute to the reader’s understanding of the underlying issues.
         On the contrary, they will probably lead to a representation of digital humanities
         as being difficult to understand and rather nerdy. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">For beginners, the criticism of the — rightly diagnosed — intransparency of modern,
         modular programming languages (cf. 40) is also of little help. In this case, it would
         have been helpful to compare programming languages with other communication systems
         (such as natural language) or modelling (such as the description of certain phenomena
         in it). After all, maximum transparency as well as all-encompassing modeling, which
         results in a perfect representation, pose similar problems to all of these systems:
         Without a certain amount of abstraction, further consideration and contextualization
         cannot take place, but abstraction can only be achieved at the expense of transparency
         because it is not always comprehensible or even reversible. Here, therefore, the computational
         aspect is not the decisive problem, but rather the human cognitive capacity and perhaps
         even more so our practice of meaning generation.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->Finally, from the point of view of digital humanities, some explicit or implicit assertions
         made by Dobson concerning basic concepts of digital humanities are irritating. For
         example, the not further explained (and wrong) equation of open source and minimal
         computing (cf. 38), the labeling of the Topic Modeling package MALLET as a »free«
         TM package and not as an open source (54), or the problematization of the Topic concept
         as different from our everyday or professional understanding that would be crucial
         but is missing (cf. 49).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">These inaccuracies and obscurations unnecessarily obstruct the access of interested
         readers or even lead to false assumptions or conclusions. They could have been avoided,
         with the contribution still achieving its reasoning regarding the need for critical
         digital humanities.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">3. Reading 3: A Critique of Exemplary Approaches to Computational Text Analysis</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In its third reading, Dobson's book can be regarded as a contribution that presents
         and discusses exemplary computational analyses of literary texts and thus implements
         his conception of critical digital humanities as criticism. In the course of the discussion
         of the typical aspects of a workflow for computational literary text analysis, Dobson
         discusses exemplary instances, some of which he supplements through his own approaches.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Dobson explains that his focus in computational approaches is on »the use of sophisticated
         quantitative methods for text and data mining« (1), because: »These text-mining approaches
         collectively represent what I take to be the strongest form of digital humanities.
         They are strong methods in the sense that they are well understood, testable, and
         from certain quarters defensible« (34).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Dobson describes a series of approaches that he examines against the background of
         his critical digital humanities. The text-mining approaches of literary studies are
         presented by him more or less explicitly as not critical enough. For instance, he
         criticizes Matthew L. Jockers’ <span style="font-style:italic">Macroanalysis</span> as ignorant with regard to methodological history (cf. 24), and his approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Text Analysis with R</span><span id="Note12_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Matthew L. Jockers, Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature, New York 2014." href="#Note12">[12]</a></span> to the chapter on cetology in Moby Dick as not informed by literary studies, since
         Jockers tries to grasp a phenomenon with lexical diversity that cannot be grasped
         that way (cf. 25f.).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Geoffrey Rockwell's and Stéfan Sinclair's <span style="font-style:italic">Hermeneutica</span>, on the other hand, are downplaying the role of algorithmic procedures in Dobson’s
         view.<span id="Note13_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Geoffrey Rockwell⁄ Stéfan Sinclair, Hermeneutica: Computer-Assisted Interpretation in the Humanities, Cambridge, Massachusetts 2016." href="#Note13">[13]</a></span> He criticizes them for providing opaque tools whose functionality they conceal by
         referring to their materiality (26f.), and which in his view should not be conceptualized
         as hermeneutica (cf. 85). Dobson develops his own concept of hermeneutica as opposed
         to theirs: »The category of hermeneutica that I am calling text-external referential
         systems are deeply embedded within specific cultural moments and, because they are
         constructed and highly curated systems, they carry with them the assumptions, preferences,
         and prejudices of their creators« (ibid.).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Regarding the work of Andrew Goldstone and Ted Underwood on the development of literary
         criticism in a corpus of literary journal articles, he acknowledges their efforts
         to methodically reflect on their approach.<span id="Note14_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Andrew Goldstone/Ted Underwood, The Quiet Transformations of Literary Studies: What Thirteen Thousand Scholars Could Tell Us, New Literary History 45…" href="#Note14">[14]</a></span> At the same time, unquestioned assumptions continue to exist in their approach, namely
         their understanding or implementation of critique as verbalized with ›critic‹, ignoring
         the other linguistic realization of literary criticism that could be made accessible
         through close reading (cf. 56f.). In addition, Dobson bemoans that Goldstone and Underwood
         do address the hermeneutic circle and the meaning of interpretation, but only start
         from the algorithmic output (cf. 63).

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->In the context of what Dobson calls text-external referential systems, he deals in
         detail with sentiment analysis approaches. He presents Jockers’ implementation of
         the <span style="font-style:italic">Syuzhet</span> Package,<span id="Note15_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="https://github.com/mjockers/syuzhet (24.09.2019)." href="#Note15">[15]</a></span> which builds on the work of Bing Liu and others, but is used for the analysis of

         the subjectivity and situatedness of the human reading process. He also compares the
         approaches of Andrew J. Reagan et al. (2016)<span id="Note17_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Andrew J. Reagan/Lewis Mitchell/Dilan Kiley/Christopher M.

         (cf. 94). Finally, he cites Jockers’ and Jodie Archers’ <span style="font-style:italic">Bestseller Code</span> as an example, criticizing it at the same time for obscurity due to the algorithm's
         inaccessibility.<span id="Note19_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Jodie Archer/Matthew Lee Jockers, The Bestseller Code: Anatomy of the Blockbuster Novel, New York 2016." href="#Note19">[19]</a></span> »[E]xamples such as this provide evidence that computational methods, especially
         those methods making use of large numbers of undisclosed variables and features, can
         also invoke the same sense of depth and obscurity as found in demystifying logics
         of Marxist and psychoanalytical approaches« (96). Such approaches are considered a
         contrast to surface reading by Dobson, which he says is usually associated with digital
         humanities.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">As a possible problem for digital humanities, Dobson sees the fact that it is often
         not humanities scholars but computer scientists who deal with such questions. However,
         due to their under-theorized and uncritical understanding of culture and literature,
         these scholars draw weak conclusions, as he shows in Jean-Baptiste Michel et al. (2011)<span id="Note20_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="J.-B. Michel/Y. K. Shen/A. P. Aiden/A.

He further problematizes this with John MacCormick who uses k-NN unreflectively
         to classify real neighbourhoods in terms of their political donation behaviour (cf.
         127f.).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><a id="heading=h.gjdgxs">
            <!--anchor--></a>Apart from this work on computational text analysis, Dobson also cites positive examples:
         He presents the Archive of American Slavery (cf. 70) as an example of an archive dealing
         with problems in archival work that go beyond the usual difficulties.<span id="Note22_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Saidiya V. Hartman, Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America, New York 1997." href="#Note22">[22]</a></span> He also points out that computational methods can help to discover gaps, and refers
         to Lauren Klein's work on »archival silence« in this archive (70f.).<span id="Note23_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Lauren F.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The example of the »thick digital maps« by Todd Presner et al. shows that historical
         geodata should not be mapped onto current map material without further ado, but must
         be enriched with suitable descriptions in order to do justice to their historical
         dimension (79f.).<span id="Note24_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Todd Samuel Presner/David Shepard/Yoh Kawano, HyperCities: Thick Mapping in the Digital Humanities. MetaLABprojects, Cambridge, Massachusetts 2014." href="#Note24">[24]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">As already mentioned, Dobson supplements the examples of computational text analysis
         with his own implementations on texts from the corpus of slave narratives: He uses
         the function collocations() from NLTK for the analysis of »An Autobiography: The Story
         of the Lord's Dealings with Mrs. Amanda Smith the Colored Evangelist« (Amanda Smith,
         1893) (cf. 22f.), performs Topic Modeling for the »Autobiography of a Female Slave«
         (Martha Brown, 1857), applies Jockers’ Syuzhet Package to »Incidents in the Life of
         a Slave Girl« (Harriet Jacobs, 1860–61), and finally uses the k-NN algorithm combined
         with »simple text-mining-tools« for the automatic literary periodization of his entire
         corpus (cf. 120–122).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Dobson's elaborations on the methods are at times incomplete in their reasoning or
         even inconsistent. For example, he notes that Jockers’ access to sentiment analysis
         may improve Liu's dictionary due to the use of scalar values, but the latter has a
         much more complex understanding of sentence structure (cf. 93). However, he neither
         explains why a scalar approach would be better than a binary one, nor why sentence
         structures are relevant. Instead, he claims that sentiment analysis has led digital
         humanities researchers back to the analysis of individual texts (cf. 95). This is
         unexpected, given the many corpus-based approaches he presents. The only single text
         analysis that he features is his own, and as he shows, its outcomes should definitely
         not be adopted. In what way, however, the results of the corpus-based approaches could
         be critically reflected due to the limited functioning of the method for 
         <!--
                       p. -->individual texts, Dobson does not remark on. Instead, he assumes: »Perhaps [...] processing
         sentiment at the macro level just does not make much sense« (ibid.). To a certain
         extent, he revises this with the very next sentence: »But in the aggregate, as part
         of a model, these plots might have some value« (ibid.). It remains open to what extent
         macro levels and aggregates can be distinguished here.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Another somewhat bewildering aspect is a statement in the context of Gadamer's hermeneutic
         circle: »The poles in Gadamer's circle are less rigidly defined than allowed for much
         work in the digital humanities« (63). It is certainly true that one cannot implement
         Gadamer’s concept in a straightforward manner. But this holds for almost all sophisticated
         concepts in the humanities. If Dobson is right with this assessment, more <span style="font-style:italic">critical</span> digital humanities will not be possible. Instead of presenting the hermeneutic circle
         as not implementable in the digital humanities, it would be interesting to discuss
         problems of formalization and operationalization from a literary criticism perspective.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In general, Dobson does not state his criteria when criticizing the (un-)suitability
         of a method. Therefore, his critique of his core examples of Topic Modeling and Sentiment
         Analysis oftentimes seems undifferentiated. In particular, it is not clear whether
         he considers the method as a whole unsuitable or if it is rather the concrete implementation
         that needs to be improved. Furthermore, general criteria for an alternative, adequate
         implementation are not given.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In addition, there is a lack of positive examples that the critical digital humanities
         could exemplify in the context of text mining. Even Dobson's own text-mining activities
         do not meet the demands he is making regarding the criticized approaches. In most
         cases, Dobson doesn't formulate a question, nor does he interpret and contextualize
         the results of his activities. Instead, he limits the application to one text only
         (with the exception of the periodization approach in chapter 4) without providing
         reasons for this. The approaches and the incorporation of their results into further
         analysis are justified neither on the basis of the specific approach presented nor
         more generally on the basis of a literary studies perspective in the sense of the
         critical digital humanities. This may be justified by the fact that Dobson’s main
         objective was to present the respective procedures. At the same time, in the context
         of the propagated critical digital humanities, an isolated consideration of the functionality
         of these procedures for mainly singular texts is at least unfortunate, because it
         misses the opportunity to highlight the potential added value of critical access using
         concrete examples.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">4. Parenthesis: Criticizing Digital Humanities with Reflected Acceptance? Structuralism
         as a Pseudo Problem
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">So, how should we handle digital humanities approaches as humanists and literary critics?
         As already mentioned above, Dobson recommends neither »outright rejection« nor »unreflective
         acceptance« (viii). He himself is certainly not at all suspicious of unreflected acceptance
         in his criticism of computational procedures; however, there is little reflected acceptance
         to be seen in detail as well. Conversely, one arguably cannot speak of outright rejection
         by Dobson at any point either. Dobson's own approach, however, leaves open the question
         as to how a reflected rejection can be distinguished from an outright rejection. Here,
         the formulation of what Dobson initially described as an extension of »the horizon
         of interpretative possibilities, in the Husserlian sense« by digital humanities would
         be helpful (x). In the beginning, he states: »This book examines the conditions of
         what might be called the seen and unseen of the interpretive scene in computational
         criticism« (ibid.), but he does not refer back to this explicitly.

         approach to the digital humanities approaches seems to stand in the way of his project.
         This goal could also have been used as an additional reading perspective for his book.
         Since the debate as to whether structuralist or post-structuralist approaches should
         be the basis for digital humanities analyses is not an intrinsic digital humanities
         debate, it was not regarded as decisive for the discussion of the critical digital
         humanities. Even though the debate has been fueled by (mainly academic) developments
         in digital humanities, there is no compelling connection between digital humanities
         and (neo-)structuralism. At least not beyond the fact, also mentioned by Dobson, that
         structuralist approaches can be more easily computationally modelled.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">While computational approaches and thus digital humanities are in principle open to
         all literary studies approaches to text analysis, the more historical and overall
         situated an approach is, the greater are the challenges it poses for modelling and
         the more profound is the necessary human intervention in the actual analysis. However,
         there is no reason why deconstructivist approaches should not be approached computationally.
         On the contrary, it is precisely those approaches that go beyond the text that advance
         the discourse on a suitable computational implementation of literary practices. Such
         approaches involving context will very probably be seen as an enrichment also by those
         who in Dobson’s view adhere to the structuralist paradigm. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Additionally, without the objection of structuralism, the requirements for the critical
         digital humanities are higher: If the reference to structuralist approaches is no
         longer sufficient to criticize an approach, other, more elaborate criteria, must be
         adopted for digital humanities criticism. This is crucial precisely because the challenge
         in digital humanities is to mediate between the more discursive, coherent and plausibility-oriented
         procedures of the humanities and the computational procedures that are more oriented
         towards repeatability and probability. Thus, quality criteria must be developed that
         do justice to both. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">5. Conclusion: Critical Digital Humanities as an ambitious endeavor to be continued</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In his book, Dobson provides a broad perspective on core issues of text analytical
         digital humanities: the effect of digitization, the situatedness of text-mining, the
         need for context and for understanding biases in algorithms. These issues are discussed
         with numerous references to both reflections on digital humanities issues as well
         as implementation-oriented approaches.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Dobson’s merit is that he tries to integrate numerous discourses and to combine fundamental
         digital humanities procedures with reflections from literary studies. The majority
         of his statements aim to highlight the situatedness of digital texts and computational
         approaches, and they do so convincingly. Dobson's plea for modelling literary (or
         humanities) textual analysis to go beyond the texts, include historical contexts and
         the subjective perspective of the researchers is sound and of great importance.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The humanities, however, have a duty to go further: Reflection and criticism should
         be followed by suggestions of ways of doing things better. The humanities and especially
         literary criticism are in demand of providing even more adequate, situated, and transparent
         approaches to computational text analysis. The goal should be to establish a variety
         of computational approaches in a characteristically humanistic way. These should in
         turn be discussed discursively and in terms of their epistemological gain as well
         as of the resulting epistemological consequences for the whole process of computational
         textual analysis.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->There are already approaches that try to implement this, and Dobson does name some
         of them. However, none of the positively discussed approaches are taken from the field
         of computational text analysis in literary studies and most of the research is North
         America-centered. Therefore, research for more positive examples within the field
         and with a broader geographic scope seems to be indicated.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Additionally, the approaches that are presented in the book are not developed to such
         an extent that they could serve as an orientation for a critical digital humanities
         practice exceeding the critique of existing approaches.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The somewhat metaphorical reference to the bag-of-words approach (cf. 78), or Dobson's
         demand for »algorithmic failure« as to be opposed by the humanities to algorithmic
         success (64), are less helpful here, since they ignore core computational models or
         procedures. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Dobson's workflow model, although having the potential to serve as a model for the
         conception and criticism of computational approaches in the spirit of the critical
         digital humanities, is not explicated appropriately either. In his general workflow
         model, Dobson introduces a step of »selection« before the computational processing,
         which is also the only decision process in the workflow otherwise consisting mainly
         of processes/activities (9). Thus, he introduces the situatedness and interpretation
         dependency at an early stage and opposes the separation of method and interpretation
         criticized by him. What he leaves out here is a more comprehensive integration of
         decision making processes in the workflow. And its adaptation for concrete workflows
         in the critical digital humanities.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The same applies to the strong fourth chapter, »The Cultural Significance of k-NN«.
         In this balanced and comprehensible chapter Dobson shows what the critical digital
         humanities he is calling for can achieve. But here, too, he limits himself to a critique.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Only his concluding sketch of the use of word embedding methods can be used as a starting
         point for a text analysis in the sense of the critical digital humanities, even though
         it is still quite general. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In summary, while there are some issues with implementation-related aspects in the
         book, Dobson provides a thought-provoking overview of critical views on digital humanities.
         He points repeatedly and with vigor at crucial aspects to consider when doing digital
         humanities in the tradition of literary criticism.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">From here we should proceed and think about concepts for the development of approaches
         in the sense of the critical digital humanities. Among others, we should answer the
         questions Dobson’s book poses, at least implicitly, such as: How can we exploit a
         (or, ideally, several) theory of meaning in computational terms that goes beyond intratextual
         contexts? Which machine learning methods do not establish a dictatorship of the majority
         or of the known, or can even model deviations from this in terms of their innovativeness,
         in order to analyze developments in literary history? 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Such alternative approaches to the dominant, implicit epistemological and political
         standpoints in algorithms and their application criticized by Dobson would be highly
         interesting. The challenge will be to design them according to the knowledge and expertise
         present in literary criticism and computational text analysis.

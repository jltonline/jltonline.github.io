      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">Review of: Ted Underwood, Distant Horizons. Digital Evidence and Literary Change.
         Chicago: The University of Chicago Press 2019. 200 p. [Price: <span class="Titel1">$ 27.50</span>]. ISBN: 9780226612836
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Digital approaches have always been met with mixed responses in literary studies.
         A decade ago, Eric Hayot likened Franco Moretti to a guy bringing liquor to a party
         of bored literary scholars who had ran out of beer.<span id="Note1_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. Eric Hayot, A Hundred Flowers in:, Jonathan Goodwin / John Holbo (eds.), Reading Graphs, Maps &amp; Trees: Responses to Franco Moretti, Anderson, SC:…" href="#Note1">[1]</a></span> Some of them are unwelcoming and stay close to their empty keg (»either because they
         have grown to love it, or because they think there’s still beer in there«<span id="Note2_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Ibid., 65." href="#Note2">[2]</a></span>), while the others praise the newcomer for saving them from boredom. Moretti’s approach
         was meant to stir things up and breathe new life into the discipline. Today, Ted Underwood
         brings his <span style="font-style:italic">Distant Horizons</span> to the same party and presents it not as a rupture and radical novelty, but rather
         as an approach that remains in perfect alignment and harmony with the history of the
         discipline, providing new types of insights for decades-old questions. Actually, it
         is hard to imagine Underwood believes in ruptures at all, given his utmost dedication
         to viewing cultural phenomena in a broad, <span style="font-style:italic">long-durée </span>context.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Two decades have passed since the publication of Moretti’s »The Slaughterhouse of
         Literature«,<span id="Note3_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. Franco Moretti, The Slaughterhouse of Literature. Modern Language Quarterly 61:1( 2000) 207–28. https://doi.org/10.1215/00267929-61-1-207." href="#Note3">[3]</a></span> one of the essays later collected in the eponymous <span style="font-style:italic">Distant Reading</span>,<span id="Note4_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. Moretti, Franco, Distant Reading, London: Verso 2013." href="#Note4">[4]</a></span> which resonates nicely with the title of Underwood’s book. This period saw many developments
         in the field of digital literary studies (DLS aka cultural analytics, computational
         literary studies, etc.), which has grown rapidly, with scholars, teams, and projects
         on all continents working on a variety of topics. During those decades we saw the
         emergence of new approaches and a new generation of scholars, accompanied by critical
         debates that shattered the field and forced it to react and constantly redefine itself.
         It is worth highlighting that over this period Moretti’s work was fruitfully criticized
         by both digital and non-digital literary scholars, and, for many reasons he is no
         longer a central reference point in the field.<span id="Note5_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. Lauren Klein, Distant Reading After Moretti. ARCADE, https://arcade.stanford.edu/blogs/distant-reading-after-moretti." href="#Note5">[5]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">So, no matter what type of beverage would be adequate to metaphorically convey Underwood’s
         contribution to the party of literary scholars, this span of almost twenty years provides
         a good opportunity to look at those changes through the lens of <span style="font-style:italic">Distant Horizons</span>, and, more broadly, through the author’s approach and arguments presented in other
         works. His claims may not seem so spectacular at first, but a closer look reveals
         their methodological soundness, theoretical awareness, and strong connection with
         the problems of literary scholarship, such as, genres, processes of literary history,
         and literary prestige. I would like to discuss <span style="font-style:italic">Distant Horizons </span>as a work somewhat typical of the current stage of DLS and the problems faced by its
         practitioners and readers.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">Computational monograph</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Before we get into details, let us start with a meta-commentary on the very form of
         this book, as I think it conveys a similar message to its contents. <span style="font-style:italic">Distant Horizons </span>is a monograph, which is the fundamental genre for the humanities in general and for
         literary scholarship in particular. At the first glance the book seems to be pretty
         similar to Underwood’s previous oeuvre, <span style="font-style:italic">Why Literary Periods Mattered</span><span style="font-weight:bold">, </span>which wrestled with similar literary and disciplinary history issues 
         <!--
                       p. -->such as the conceptualisation of literary processes by the scholarly community, the
         problems of prestige in literary culture, and the durability of its models.<span id="Note6_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. Ted Underwood, Why Literary Periods Mattered: Historical Contrast and the Prestige of English Studies. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press 201…" href="#Note6">[6]</a></span> However, if we lay both books side by side on the table, interesting differences
         begin to emerge. Let us compare the tables of contents. <span style="font-style:italic">Why Literary Periods Mattered </span>has six chapters and an introduction, whereas <span style="font-style:italic">Distant Horizons </span>consists of five chapters, a preface, and two appendices. This already signals that
         something has changed; but let us dig deeper. The earlier work has three figures and
         no tables at all, compared to, respectively, twenty four and four in the recent book.
         Moreover, the median number of notes per page in the former book (1.82) is almost
         two times greater than in <span style="font-style:italic">Distant Horizons </span>(0.95), which hints at different argumentative styles for the volumes: the first one
         being devoted to discussing other texts, and the second focused on the presentation
         of empirical results. A text mining of these two volumes may yield even more insights,
         but, I just wanted to use these examples to show that although <span style="font-style:italic">Distant Horizons </span>is a traditional monograph it seems to have evolved into a slightly different genre,
         one which I would call here, a ›computational monograph‹.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The erosion of the genre begins at the level of form, as the traditional printed codex,
         which has been around for over half a millennium, seem to be ill-equipped to handle
         and connect heterogeneous methodologies and supplementary materials such as code and
         data. The discussion of data and method has been quite artificially moved from the
         main thread to the appendices, as if the main argument was more about the result than
         the method. It may also suggest that this book invites two modes of reading: the ›regular
         mode‹ of following the core scholarly argument, and the ›enhanced mode‹ that assumes
         a more digressive engagement with the method and data. It is important to mention
         that the latter option invites readers to go beyond the book and consult supplementary
         material stored on GitHub and safely deposited in Zenodo trusted repository.<span id="Note7_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="https://github.com/tedunderwood/horizon, https://zenodo.org/record/1207277" href="#Note7">[7]</a></span> Actually, the common concept of a ›supplement‹ is quite misleading here as this is
         rather a ›primary‹, ›basic‹, or ›fundamental‹ collection of code and data used at
         various stages of the research process along with notes for those who wish to use
         them. Materials deposited online can be (and have been) updated after the book has
         been published. Thus, the printed volume is only one of the gates to this research
         project and its outputs.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Such exemplary transparency in allowing for data and code reuse, and the replication
         of the results, needs a loud commendation as it is still not common in DLS. I read
         it as a practical response to the so-called replication crisis and the criticism directed
         at the first wave of DLS scholars like Moretti and Jockers, who were reluctant to
         publish and describe the sources of their conclusions.<span id="Note8_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf.Katherine Bode, The Equivalence of Close and Distant Reading; or, Toward a New Object for Data-Rich Literary History. Modern Language Quarterly 78…" href="#Note8">[8]</a></span> Underwood encourages rigorous replication and testing of his results to ensure the
         proper development of the field (cf. 174).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The publication of these materials also gives a hint of the scale of the work required
         to reach the conclusions presented in this book. Hundreds of lines of code and large
         datasets had to be created beforehand and worked through for long hours in order to
         arrive at results that could be discussed in the chapters of <span style="font-style:italic">Distant Horizons</span>. Moreover, some software was also specifically written for data preprocessing (as
         was BookNLP in the case of this book), to make further exploration even possible.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The authorship is another interesting feature that differentiates the two books in
         question. While both volumes are based on previously published work, in the case of
         <span style="font-style:italic">Why Literary Periods Mattered</span> these were Underwood’s solo outputs, while <span style="font-style:italic">Distant Horizons</span> dwells on co-authored papers, and collaboratively created software and datasets.
         However, the final output in both cases is presented in the form of an individual
         monograph. Thus, <span style="font-style:italic">Distant Horizons </span>contains previous teamwork that has been subject to the overall (and individual) argument
         of the monograph and then filtered through it. And I am not suggesting here that Underwood
         considers this solely his own work – on the contrary, he has acknowledged minutely
         all of his contributors. 
         <!--
                       p. -->Yet, what is interesting is that our current modes of authorship do not handle multiple
         contributions to a monograph well, which, in the end, reflects the work of an individual
         scholar, but, on the other hand, would not be possible without the help of others.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Defining the target readership of such monographs poses similar challenges. Digital
         humanities work has always had, at least, a dual audience: scholars of a particular
         discipline, who know the context but not the method; and digital humanists, who can
         critically evaluate the method but not the originality of the contribution for the
         state of the art – as they specialise in different (sub)disciplines. In Underwood’s
         case we may also count a growing number of scholars who form a common part of these
         two groups, that is, experts both in method and subject. However, bridging the gap
         between these communities is a routine challenge for most writing in DLS (or perhaps
         in DH). It results in a certain duplicity of argument that has to present computational
         methodology as a valid way of arriving at scholarly conclusions for non-experts, while
         giving enough detail for digital-savvy researchers to be able to scrutinize the results
         of distant reading. It is also hard to keep every reader of an interdisciplinary work
         satisfied, as Underwood acknowledges: »[c]olleagues from sciences will urge a writer
         to add more statistical tests. Formalist critics will ask for more close readings.
         Book historians will ask for a bibliography that separates different editions« (156).
         A distant reader has to address all these audiences sufficiently while presenting
         the outcomes of their analysis.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This duplicity also highlights the problems with evaluating a computational monograph.
         Reviewers are usually tasked with assessing the claims being made, and their contribution
         to the relevant field of study. They may discuss the method, theoretical assumptions,
         and interpretive strategy, judging their validity and suitability. However, a review
         of computational work also invites different kinds of scrutiny, ones that are not
         very common in the humanities, like the replication of analytical procedures, or testing
         them on different material. Underwood expects to trigger a different kind of reception
         and criticism by sharing the supporting material online. He also treats it as a way
         of avoiding superficial criticism and inviting deeper engagement with the project:
         »[w]hen an author has shared code and voluminous data, it is no longer enough to draw
         up a list of scattered errors and omissions« (183). That sets the bar very high and
         requires a huge amount of additional work, especially if one wants to collect new
         material to test these conclusions.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Such a challenge was recently undertaken by Nan Z. Da, who reviewed multiple DLS articles
         in her hotly debated »The Computational Case against Computational Literary Studies«
         (2019). Da ventured to scrutinise the use of statistics in these papers, trying to
         replicate their results whenever she could access the data and code. She arrived at
         the conclusion that there is »a fundamental mismatch between the statistical tools
         that are used and the objects to which they are applied«.<span id="Note9_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Nan Z. Da, The Computational Case against Computational Literary Studies. Critical Inquiry 45:3 (2019), 601." href="#Note9">[9]</a></span> One of the articles she criticised was Underwood’s »The Life Cycle of Genres«, later
         expanded into Chapter two of <span style="font-style:italic">Distant Horizons. </span>Da questioned the procedure of model training (although actually Underwood had applied
         it in a manner she had advocated for), and for using a different definition of a genre
         than Moretti had, whose work Underwood had endeavoured to scrutinise. She concluded
         that Underwood’s results are too peculiar to mean anything: »if everyone can agree
         that something is changing – even Underwood concedes that genres evolve – but you
         have devised one way that concludes that it does not, it does not necessarily mean
         that you have found something. It just means your instrument of measurement might
         be too weak – your method might have too little power – to capture this kind of change«.<span id="Note10_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Ibid., 608." href="#Note10">[10]</a></span> Underwood’s subsequent rebuttal resonates with other reactions by DLS scholars taking
         part in the discussion on the <span style="font-style:italic">Critical Inquiry</span> online forum: »Da’s own argument remains limited by its assumption that statistics
         is an alien world, where humanistic guidelines like ›acknowledge context‹ are replaced
         by rigid hypothesis-testing protocols. But the colleagues who follow her 
         <!--
                       p. -->will recognize, I hope, that statistical reasoning is an extension of ordinary human
         activities like exploration and debate«.<span id="Note11_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Ted Underwood’s response to the Critical Inquiry forum dedicated to Da’s article: https://critinq.wordpress.com/2019/03/31/computational-literary-stud…" href="#Note11">[11]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">I find this exchange elucidating, for what constitutes a computational monograph,
         together with the previously discussed issues of form and authorship. A computational
         monograph relies on the productive tension between the confirmatory approaches of
         statistics, and the exploratory applications of those methods in digital humanities
         work. And so, this mode of analysis entails the qualitative interpretation of quantitative
         insights, which has to be anchored in a particular context or field. In other words,
         quantitative approaches provide some hints, the meaning of which is elucidated by
         qualitative explanations. For Underwood, statistical methods serve as tools that enable
         literary insight and help answer truly disciplinary questions. This seems to be the
         spirit of the computational monograph, which is both singular and plural at the same
         time: it collates the evidence but channels it through the individual viewpoint of
         a scholar, who then forms it into a narrative.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">Distant perspective</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This dualism is present in the very title of this book, <span style="font-style:italic">Distant Horizons</span>, which – aside from having the same acronym as Digital Humanities – refers to the
         limitation of a singular perspective. »A single pair of eyes at ground level can't
         grasp the curve of the horizon, and arguments limited by a single reader's memory
         can't reveal the largest patterns organising literary history« (x). Only if we position
         ourselves above ground level may we notice the curve. And the same goes for literary
         studies: computational methods give us a different scale of reading; it enables a
         processual, rather than a discrete understanding of literary history. The foundational
         claim of this book is that literary studies have a rich literary-historical knowledge,
         within »certain chronological limits«, that allows the author’s movements and periods
         to be characterised; but, their application on the macro-scale of broader processes
         poses serious difficulties (cf. 8). In other words, Underwood focuses on the mid-range
         claims of literary scholarship, for example, those dedicated to a particular period,
         and raises them above ground level to explore their validity as long-range phenomena
         spanning centuries along a continuous timeline (cf. 20).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In many ways, <span style="font-style:italic">Distant Horizons </span>continues Underwood’s quest for computational-savvy literary studies, as imitated
         in the last chapter of <span style="font-style:italic">Why Literary Periods Mattered</span>, yet, with a certain twist. He used to believe that »[q]uantitative methods will
         be easier for us to assimilate when they conform to our preference for discontinuity«;<span id="Note12_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. Ted Underwood. Why…, 166." href="#Note12">[12]</a></span> that is, to a way of looking at the history as a series of graspable, discrete periods.
         However, in <span style="font-style:italic">Distant Horizons</span>, instead of having these methods adapted to the sequential perspective of literary
         studies, he would rather expect literary studies to embrace the continuity.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">So, why does literary scholarship fail to recognise these methods and, so, remain
         largely sceptical? Underwood seems to locate the reason for this slow expansion in
         disciplinary specificity. Firstly, computers have made textual modelling possible
         only recently, which may explain textual scholars’ earlier lack of interest in the
         use of statistics and thus its smaller uptake. Given that only a handful of humanists
         mastered statistics, we cannot expect massive engagement with such scholarship. The
         second reason, closely interlinked with the first one, is that DLS results cannot
         yet be fully appreciated and may be ahead of their time, as »researchers have begun
         by tracing phenomena that don't yet have literary significance for a community of
         readers« (16f.). 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->There are, therefore, certain findings that raise our curiosity, but that are hard
         to embed in broader literary historical knowledge. Underwood stresses that although
         the computational results may sound superficial or simplistic, they demand a proper
         interpretation. For instance, some interpretation is required of the fact that certain
         terms are clearly gendered, as in the analyses described in chapter four that reveal
         that fictional »[w]omen smile and laugh, but midcentury men, apparently, can only
         grin and chuckle« (124). Just as in the humanities, which are sometimes called out
         to prove their usefulness to society, DLS (and more broadly DH) is subjected to the
         same treatment: to show its relevance to the humanities. This is why chapter two is
         not so much about defining genres and their characteristic features, but rather about
         the usefulness of genre models for solving theoretical debates. On a broader scale,
         <span style="font-style:italic">Distant Horizons</span> aims to bridge the gap between literary scholarship and computational findings by
         consequently presenting it in a coherent, exploratory workflow.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">Exploratory approach</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Let us try to distil the main features of Underwood’s approach. It entails building
         models through perspective modelling and providing a qualitative interpretation of
         quantitative findings. We already know the basic assumption that the quantitative
         and qualitative analysis are intertwined into a single workflow, which is rather exploratory,
         not confirmatory. Underwood is very clear that mere numbers do not substitute for
         interpretation, as they are just signs with »no special power to settle questions«
         (xviii). Instead, they serve as a vehicle for viewing and interpreting problems at
         a larger scale. And this precise feature seems to be a bone of contention for both
         statisticians, who are critical of loosening the restrictions of the quantitative
         approach; and humanities scholars, who see the use of numbers as a reductionist simplification
         of complex textuality. Quantitative models, Underwood reminds us, are »no more objective
         than any other historical interpretation; they are just another way to grapple with
         the mystery of the human past« (xix). Computational analysis serves here as a modelling
         system of higher order that translates literary history into models, which may provide
         new insights that still need to be interpreted.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Before moving on to the interpretation, let us discuss how the models are constructed.
         Underwood criticises the notion of operationalisation advocated by Moretti for DLS
         (who understood it as »building a bridge from concepts to measurement«),<span id="Note13_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. Moretti, Franco: ’’Operationalizing“, or, the function of measurement in modern literary theory. Literary Lab Pamphlet 6 (2013), 3. http://litlab…" href="#Note13">[13]</a></span> by calling out the arbitrariness of choosing what actually constitutes such a measurement.
         Instead he employs ›perspectival modelling‹, that is, he uses the actual perspectives
         of historical readers to train his models. For instance, he does not try to establish
         which features constitute the genre of detective fiction, but rather takes the actual
         texts which are labelled by scholars as belonging to this genre, and extracts the
         features which distinguish this group of works from other texts. It should be noted
         that he does not abandon operationalisation altogether, but rather advocates for supporting
         it with available evidence, because, in the end, some operationalisation is needed
         to convey fuzzier notions like that of a literary prestige, which Underwood operationalises
         as the »probability that an author will be discussed in certain elite periodicals«
         (73). Similarly, academic citations serve as a proxy for cultural capital, and the
         number of editions in libraries stands for economic success (cf. 98).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Another important assumption is that models should go beyond simple word counts and
         include multiple textual features. Writing about models for gender in fiction, Underwood
         spells out the main reason behind this principle: »everything affects everything:
         as usual with statistics, there is no single cause« (128). Underwood applies supervised
         machine learning, training his models on one part of the sample and testing them on
         another. This procedure creates a literary model, 
         <!--
                       p. -->which is just another representation of literary history, and needs further interpretation
         and historical contextualisation to acquire meaning (cf. 37).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This is a tricky part of the method as it is also the essence of the mixed-methods
         approach: statistically generated models display a certain pattern (i.e. particular
         groups of words are linked to the phenomenon being researched and others are not),
         which are then qualitatively interpreted by scholars and assessed against the existing
         body of literary scholarship. Chapter four is a good example of the difficulties in
         moving from the distant view to interpretation, as it tries to juxtapose nine hundred
         words that increase the probability that a book of poems will be reviewed, with the
         other nine hundred that point in the opposite direction (cf. 84 sq.). Two sets amounting
         to almost two thousand words are pretty difficult to interpret, even when some vocabulary
         is presented in the context of a sample poem that highlights certain differences.
         Underwood then aims to reduce this complexity by classifying these words in Harvard’s
         General Inquirer lists, grouping the vocabulary into those relevant to colours, body
         parts, first-person singular, natural objects, and weakness. But even if Underwood
         shows there is a weak correlation between the text’s usage of words from these groups
         and being reviewed, it leaves readers with the need for more explanation. And it is
         not that simple to put all these features in a coherent and engaging explanatory narrative,
         which – as he notes elsewhere in the book – poses the real, aesthetic challenge: »it
         is simply hard to write with sweep and verve about thousands of books« (156). DLS
         seeks to find ways of presenting such results in a meaningful and accessible way,
         and although Underwood’s work serves as a good example here, there is still more to
         be achieved in this respect.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">Discoveries</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Now that we have reconstructed the main assumptions behind his work, let us try to
         assess the outcomes of their application – something Underwood calls discoveries.
         What all chapters have in common is the scale of the description embracing the <span style="font-style:italic">longue durée</span> of literary history. Wide perspectives allow the isolated facts (or observations
         conflated to certain ›periods‹) to be understood as elements of a continuous, long-lasting
         processes. Thus, a discrete understanding of literary history as a series of consecutive
         periods is substituted by reflection on the broader, underlying processes.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This continuity is already visible in the scope of the chapters, which explore some
         of the traditional topics in literary studies. The first three chapters analyse the
         dimensions of literary history – namely forms, genres and prestige – with volumes
         discussed as wholes. Chapter one tracks genre transformation in the fiction of the
         eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries, framing it as a continuous process
         of differentiating literary language from ›non-fiction‹. Chapter two provides a similar
         perspective on the evolution of three genres (detective, gothic, and science fiction).
         In some cases (e.g. science fiction) it argues that genre consolidation had taken
         place even earlier than suspected. Interestingly, some models trained only on earlier
         works can recognize the same genre at later stages. This seems to oppose Moretti’s
         claim about the ›seasonality‹ of genres, in favour of positing more durable patterns;
         although Underwood doesn’t look at subgenres like Moretti did in <span style="font-style:italic">Graphs</span>.<span id="Note14_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Franco Moretti, Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for a Literary History. London: Verso, 2005. It should be stressed that in his discussion of sub…" href="#Note14">[14]</a></span> Chapter three seems to confirm (albeit with some level of complication) the evolutionary
         differentiation between popular and critically acclaimed works. Instead of picturing
         the separation of the ›highbrow‹ and ›lowbrow‹ outputs as a rupture or the ›great
         divide‹, Underwood provides a model of the slow, continuous diversification of these
         types of writing (cf. 72 sq.). This very chapter may be seen as additionally validating
         his entire approach, because the events that, in a short frame of time, were considered
         revolutionary, could now be seen in the broader picture as elements of an evolutionary
         trend. The fourth chapter zooms in to the level of textual content, exploring how
         
         <!--
                       p. -->fictional characters are shaped by assumptions about gender and how this implicit
         gendering grows blurrier after 1840.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Underwood depicts the ›long arc‹ of certain literary processes, claiming that changes
         are not so rapid and generational as had been believed. Or rather, we scrutinized
         these processes at a smaller scale, unable to account for them in their entirety.
         This, of course, may raise some doubts as to whether the scale itself does not impose
         certain limits on granularity; that is, looking at the dominant arc may keep the influence
         of alternative or short-lived processes in the background. 
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">The Future</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the last chapter, under the banner of »Risks of Distant Reading«, Underwood explores
         the disciplinary and institutional dimensions of the shift towards computational methods.
         He moves from the defensive approach of arguing for computation that he presented
         in the humanities in <span style="font-style:italic">Why Literary Periods Mattered</span>, to the more offensive stand of seeing it as an integral part of the future of the
         discipline. Underwood is pretty optimistic in assuming that computational methods
         can be applied everywhere in literary studies, and can also supplement every close-reading
         in the manner proposed in his book and discussed throughout this review (cf. 147).
         He assumes that the complexity of new methods, requiring not only access to data but
         also coding and statistical skills, are the reasons behind their low popularity among
         humanists (cf. 145). However, he argues, that this is not as big an obstacle as it
         may seem, as distant readers »need a semester of statistics and some programming experience
         (and perhaps a course in social science) added to their training in literary history«
         (163) in order to start posing valid questions, and applying these methods to answer
         them.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">However, there are already many tools available that serve users who don’t have an
         advanced knowledge of programing (e.g. Voyant), which assist in close readings and
         have various word-frequency features. Still, the uptake is quite slow, which may suggest
         that it is not so much a question of competence, but of accepting these tools as valid
         instruments of analysis in literary studies. And here again, Underwood has something
         to add about the fundamentally interdisciplinary nature of DLS. He encourages us to
         go beyond the binary oppositions between the qualitative and quantitative approaches
         and embrace new modes of inquiry suitable for the twenty-first century. This involves
         not only humanists understanding and applying quantitative methods, but also scientists
         opening up to the doubt and uncertainty of humanities research. »Mutual understandings
         would lead us away from the fantasy that objectivity and subjectivity represent firmly
         distinct alternatives and toward a more flexible conversation about human attempts
         to understand the world by modelling it« (158). So, as he put it in another essay,
         humanists need to know how machine learning works to »understand why the boundary
         between quantitative and qualitative reasoning is growing fuzzier«.<span id="Note15_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Ted Underwood, Dear Humanists: Fear Not the Digital Revolution. The Chronicle of Higher Education, 27 March 2019, https://www.chronicle.com/article/D…" href="#Note15">[15]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This is something more than just a methodological endeavour. Embracing new methodologies
         is also important for students in order to prepare them »for a world where information
         is filtered by computers«.<span id="Note16_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Ted Underwood, Why an Age of Machine Learning Needs the Humanities. Public Books, 5 December 2018, https://www.publicbooks.org/why-an-age-of-machine-…" href="#Note16">[16]</a></span> So, the computational method is actually not only a handy tool for literary analysis
         but also a vehicle for understanding contemporary culture. He points out that statistical
         methods have already found their way into departments of sociology, communication,
         and information science, so there is no excuse for literary studies to lag behind.
         And this is precisely the approach Underwood consequently advocates in his works;
         so let us conclude with the title of one of his essays: »Dear Humanists: Fear Not
         the Digital Revolution«. Embrace it!

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Titel_Rezension">The Benefits of Bringing Cognitive Sciences into Ecocriticism</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">Alexa Weik von Mossner, Affective Ecologies: Empathy, Emotion, and Environmental Narrative.
         Columbus: Ohio State UP 2017. X, 288 p. [$ 149,95]. ISBN: 978-0-8142-1336-0.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">As its succinct title indicates, Alexa Weik von Mossner’s <span style="font-style:italic">Affective Ecologies: Empathy, Emotion, and Environmental Narrative</span> makes the case for incorporating insights from cognitive science in environmental
         studies. It is somewhat surprising, Weik points out, that this case still needs to
         be made after more than twenty years of ecocritical scholarship. Not only did the
         entire ecocritical project derive from an empirical science – ecology – but it built
         to a significant extent on the assumption that environmental texts exert a deep and
         effective impact on their readers. Nevertheless, few ecocritics have drawn on cognitive
         science, and even fewer have done so in a systematic manner. <span style="font-style:italic">Affective Ecologies</span> fills this gap and convincingly demonstrates the benefits of a cognitive ecocriticism.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The study is organized around the question of how environmental »narratives appeal
         to our sensual perception and embodied cognition […] to immerse us into their storyworlds«
         (2–3). The term ›embodied cognition‹ refers to the work of neurologists, most influentially
         Vittorio Gallese, who have shown that humans respond to their social and material
         environments by mapping movements around them onto their own bodies. This kind of
         embodiment, which Gallese calls ›simulation‹, serves various functions, including
         empathy, which we attain by recreating facial expressions and bodily contortions.
         Research indicates that these mechanisms are at play regardless of whether the counterparts
         we perceive and emulate are human or nonhuman, real or imaginary.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This remarkable observation creates various openings for literary and film studies,
         which, after all, specialize in examining the creation and impact of imaginary worlds.
         The obvious point of connection is reader-response criticism. It is ideally positioned
         to bridge the gap between neurological research and textual analysis, or in other
         words, to explain how textual structures activate embodied cognition. A narrative
         of someone’s experience of the environment, Weik points out, »is different from a
         scientific account in that it will allow those who receive it […] to simulate that
         sense of feeling in their minds« (7). The six chapters of <span style="font-style:italic">Affective Ecologies</span> draw on reader-response theory accordingly, but also on narratology and animal studies,
         to make a comprehensive yet coherent case for imaginative narratives as particularly
         complex and effective vehicles of embodied simulation.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The first chapter examines the traditional environmentalist claim that nature description
         can raise awareness of environmental issues. It brings the concept of embodied simulation
         to bear on John Muir’s classic <span style="font-style:italic">The Mountains of California</span> (1894) and on a recent environmental novel, Bonnie Nadzam’s <span style="font-style:italic">Lamb</span> (2011). A main insight of the chapter is that the reader’s perception of and transportation
         into the literary environment is affected by narrative and descriptive strategies
         that work the same way in fictional and non-fictional texts. The second chapter points
         out, however, that expectations of authenticity continue to make a difference because
         recipients bring them only to non-fictional texts. Drawing on environmental film,
         the chapter shows once again that viewers’ perception of the environment works along
         the same lines in disaster movies and documentaries. In terms of cognition, it does
         not matter whether the film 
         <!--
                       p. -->was really shot in the environment in which it is set, as audiences’ responses to
         the extraterrestrial settings of many science-fiction films indicate. Non-fictional
         documentaries are measured by different standards, however, which indicates the interplay
         of biological and cultural factors in the reception process.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">A main reason why audiences demand authenticity from environmental documentaries is
         that the ethical arguments these documentaries raise usually presuppose the facticity
         of the environments, actors, and stories they present. The third chapter of <span style="font-style:italic">Affective Ecologies</span> shows that these ethical arguments too rely on the skillful manipulation of cognitive
         processes, especially the creation of empathy with people who have been wronged. The
         chapter examines a range of environmental justice narratives to demonstrate the importance
         of narrative and filmic perspective in creating empathy. The following chapter extends
         the scope to representations of animals and shows that trans-species empathy relies
         on the same cognitive processes as human empathy. While animated movies can directly
         tap this potential by anthropomorphizing their animal characters, other filmic genres
         often deploy human characters who empathize with suffering animals as objective correlatives
         in order to cue corresponding responses in the audience. The use of masked human actors
         or computer-generated imagery blurs the boundaries between purportedly authentic and
         animated movies, as Weik highlights in a reading of Michael Apted’s <span style="font-style:italic">Gorillas in the Mist</span> (1988), so that anthropomorphism can be found across the genres. A more extensive
         discussion of literary texts could have supported and further deepened the argument
         of this chapter, as writers have a broader range of anthropomorphizing strategies
         at their disposal (adopting the perspective of animals, for example) and can mix these
         strategies more subtly with realistic description.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The last two chapters turn to narratives about the future, which tend to have a strong
         environmental dimension because they often feature a drastic change of ecosystemic
         conditions that separates the narrative future from the present. These chapters draw
         on sociological and psychological research to inquire how literary and filmic texts
         activate recipients’ emotions to create or negotiate a sense of risk. Drawing on a
         wide range of examples, from T. C. Boyle’s <span style="font-style:italic">A Friend of the Earth</span> (2000) to James Cameron’s <span style="font-style:italic">Avatar</span> (2009), the chapters examine negative and positive emotions respectively. They conclude
         that both kinds of emotions can successfully be activated by imaginative narratives
         and that both can (but do not necessarily) instigate the recipients to promote political
         and social change.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Chapter 5, on negative emotions, offers a particularly strong analysis of narrative
         strategies and the temporalities they establish in literary texts. This indicates
         one of the contributions the study makes to the environmental humanities. It taps
         the literary studies heritage of ecocriticism for a dialogue between the natural and
         the cultural sciences—in this case, between cognitive and textual research. A close
         reading like that of John Muir’s writings in chapter 1 demonstrates the value of the
         kind of nuanced approach and aesthetic sensitivity that literary studies can bring
         to this dialogue. While many of Weik’s insights about literary and filmic texts could
         have been attained without the cognitive studies framework, that framework often sharpens
         the readings and helps contextualize their findings. It also challenges several myths
         that continue to influence ecocriticism, for example the assumption that texts need
         to transmit an authentic experience of nature in order to instigate environmental
         awareness. ›Authentic‹ is a rather fluid category already, but the finding that the
         cognitive effect of films does not depend on a correspondence between the fictional
         and the actual location is a striking example of the discursive construction of environmental
         awareness.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Weik actually makes a more complex argument at this point in her study, suggesting
         that in non-fictional texts the authenticity of the setting and the human and animal
         protagonists matters to audiences (cf. 69–70). Confronted with a dearth of empirical
         research on audience responses, 
         <!--
                       p. -->her argument here leaves the realm of cognitive science and shifts to the discursive
         mediation of filmic experience, for example to paratexts that assert or question the
         film’s authenticity. This indicates a general challenge in cognitive ecocriticism:
         the uneven availability of empirical data. Scholars who do not have the means of conducting
         large-scale studies themselves are left with the choice between limiting their discussion
         to a few empirically researched examples, or foregoing empirical validity and conducting
         their own close readings in the philological tradition of reception aesthetics.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Weik chooses the latter, which enables her to offer a broad, representative discussion
         of contemporary environmental narratives but sometimes limits her discussion of cognitive
         reception processes to her own reading or viewing experience. As critics of reception
         aesthetics have pointed out, this strategy entails the risk of universalizing one’s
         own perspective. Weik notes at the beginning of her study that »we interact with such
         narratives on the mental and affective level in ways that are both biologically universal
         and culturally specific« (3). The interplay of the universal and the specific recurs
         throughout the study but is not always addressed explicitly. Weik often refers to
         the viewers and readers of her texts as ›we‹, which raises the question of who that
         ›we‹ is and to what extent it is culturally specific. Sometimes the viewer or reader
         is individualized as ›she‹, suggesting that some reception processes may be gender-specific,
         but this is not explicitly discussed either.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Where the study does take cultural specificity into account, it succeeds in offering
         nuanced interpretations of the reception process, for example on the Western and Japanese
         responses to the dolphin-hunting documentary <span style="font-style:italic">The Cove</span> (2009). Such passages indicate that the cultural and historical locatedness of specific
         audience groups provides rich material for further research in cognitive ecocriticism,
         particularly for scholars interested in questions of environmental justice. <span style="font-style:italic">Affective Ecologies</span> convincingly demonstrates that ecocriticism has much to gain from incorporating the
         insights of cognitive studies. The abovementioned questions around universality and
         specificity indicate that this interdisciplinary dialogue could fruitfully be extended
         to the methodological level. Its wide range of material, deep familiarity with ecocritical
         debate, and innovative use of insights from the cognitive sciences makes Weik’s study
         an important addition to environmental scholarship in general, and to ongoing inquiries
         into the role of empirical approaches in ecocriticism in particular.

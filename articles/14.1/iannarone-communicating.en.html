      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Titel_Rezension">(Abstract)</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">Full-length article in: JLT 14/1 (2020), 55–75.</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Today, as announced by this special issue, the contest of interpretation against aesthetic
         experience appears urgent and timely. For surely a critical profession should clarify
         its sense of how to proceed before actually engaging to do so. But how are we to have
         any such sense in advance of an encounter with the literary text, ostensible object
         of the discipline? I argue that it is only within the limits of critique, as met with
         in the objectivity of the artwork, that we might be confident of our interpretations.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">To paraphrase Hegel, literary interpretation misses an advantage enjoyed by the natural
         sciences (Hegel 1959, 33). Although recourse may be made to individual works of formal
         writing in »evidence« of a theory, still, no literary interpretation can presume its
         methods to be already accepted. Moreover, purely »systematic or theoretical« discussions
         of interpretation ring hollow when and, indeed, because they are empty of perceptible
         content. For the honest reader, the literary artwork remains sensibly resilient or
         resistant to, not to say frustrating of, systematic discussions – and this must be
         taken into account. As readers (rather than philosophers) of literature we are in
         luck, for even (or especially) without determining the meaning of a given work, we
         have before us something that remains »outside« of us. In sustaining his or her attention
         to this external object (and in coming to regard it as an »artwork«), and thus compelled
         to see the qualitative distance within and structuring experience, the reader finds
         that the text is more than just some thing or technical device to conceal meaning.
         It is what Adorno calls »the objectivity« of the artwork produced by the »movement
         of the mind« of the subject that, I argue, critiques the apparent choice of independent
         meaning or independent sensuousness as alternative bases for interpretive practice
         (Adorno 1983, 19). The literary work, as it becomes objective for its reader, becomes
         too a limit upon how that reader interprets it, that is, a limit upon the merely subjective.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The trouble with the question of whether to privilege the sensuousness or the meaning
         of art, is that it is framed as though this were still a choice to be made, as if
         the one could be isolated from, and be taken without concern for the other. Perhaps
         we cannot be reminded too often, as Claudia Brodsky reminds us, that not since the
         »first modern redefinition« of the »aesthetic« in Kant’s Third Critique could »specific
         content« be »considered in isolation from form«. No more can the critical project
         be put back into the bottle, than the »dynamism« of form articulated through Kant’s
         analysis of aesthetic judgment be reduced once more to either static form or content.
         The consideration of »meaning« isolated from form must remain, alas, the advantage
         of the natural sciences. If, as Brodsky continues with Kant’s definition, »dynamic,
         ›purposive‹ form causes our pleasure in the aesthetic«, then the consideration of
         sensory experience isolated from form »remains tied to [the] original, ancient meaning«
         of »aesthetic«, »that of pertaining to any sensory experience at all« (Brodsky 1997,
         376). If subsequently it has come to seem as though the (external) »uncovering of
         meaning« and (internal) »aesthetic pleasure« are at incommunicable odds, we must recall
         that these two cannot be separated out from one another in the analysis of a perceptible
         object without the aesthetic disappearing entirely from view – for, by modern definition,
         the appearance of their mutual implication is what we mean when 
         <!--
                       p. -->we call something an »aesthetic« object. The clean, absolute break between subject
         and object implicit in the ancient definition is irreparably complicated by Kant’s
         radical analysis of aesthetic perception and its implication that subjectivity and
         formal objecthood cannot be insulated, one from the other. Even when the ancient meaning
         of »aesthetic« is taken up in order to speak again of sensation as bracketed off from
         form, such considerations are not to our advantage as interpreters and critics of
         literature, but rather lead into other, more positive disciplines, having no purchase
         upon that doubling movement of the formal object and perceiving subject. The consequences
         of this critical redefinition for the practice of literary interpretation are still
         not settled, or even if theoretically settled, not yet absorbed into practice.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The editors of this special issue have proposed an impasse in, or crisis between aesthetics
         and interpretation as our subject today. Within the tradition of aesthetics as dynamic
         form or double movement sketched here between Kant and Adorno, I locate another radical
         tradition of interpretation, that of black aesthetic critique. With the particular
         sensory availability of visual art in mind, this essay considers not only James Weldon
         Johnson’s <span style="font-style:italic">The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man</span> (1912), but also a work in another medium and separated by a long century in the
         political arc of black subjects in the United States, an untitled etching by the artist
         Glenn Ligon. With reference to discussions by Darby English (2005), Marie de Brugerolle
         (1995) and Andrea Miller-Keller (1992), this essay analyzes the ways in which Ligon’s
         etching is irreducible to his political identity. For one of the most powerful effects
         of the visibly differentiated presence of Ligon’s work is its ability to make us »see«
         that the intentional structure of an artwork, i. e. the interrelating of parts internal
         to itself, much like the fictively »autobiographical« structure of <span style="font-style:italic">ECM</span>, does not so much »communicate« or teach us about race in the United States, as use
         patterned abstraction to critique the impulse to turn to aesthetic objects to explicate
         social conditions, extract recognizable meanings, or ground political decisions. These
         works do not allow themselves to be read unproblematically as about black lives or
         as representative of black situations. Their »difficulty« inhibits any reading (whether
         called phenomenological or ontological) in which the difference of material and representation,
         or the difference of the representational and the representative is collapsed in an
         attempt to enjoy a clearer, less troubled (less literary) view <span style="font-style:italic">through</span> the perspective ostensibly afforded by the (black authored) work, as though it were
         a transparent »window« either onto the world or »into« the (black) subject. Furthermore,
         because each of these works self-consciously situate themselves within the troubled
         socio-history of black autobiography, black literacy, and presupposing racialist ontologies,
         what I will describe as their <span style="font-style:italic">objectivity</span> upsets not only ontological accounts, but also those social fictions of race that,
         among other more lethal consequences, have interpreted and continue to interpret works
         such as these to be »representative« of black experience. Considering the canon of
         African American literature by closely examining selected texts containing critiques
         of that very category, I propose, as it were, a third way, one that heeds the artwork’s
         own critique of interpretation and so helps us to move beyond the impasse suggested
         by the editors. The potential of the art object is critical. The aim of the analytic
         work in this current study is to restore to our encounter with these works the capacities
         for aesthetic attention and judgement occasioned by all »authentic« artworks, that
         is, works that do <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> conform to their audiences’ expectations.

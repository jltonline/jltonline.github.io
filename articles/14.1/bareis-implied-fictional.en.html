      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Titel_Rezension">The Implied Fictional Narrator</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Titel_Rezension">(Abstract)</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">Full-length article in: JLT 14/1 (2020), 120–138.</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The role of the narrator in fiction has recently received renewed interest from scholars
         in philosophical aesthetics and narratology. Many of the contributions criticise how
         the term is used – both outside of narrative literature as well as within the field
         of fictional narrative literature. The central part of the attacks has been the ubiquity
         of fictional narrators, see e. g. Kania (2005), and pan-narrator theories have been
         dismissed, e. g. by Köppe and Stühring (2011). Yet, the fictional narrator has been
         a decisive tool within literary narratology for many years, in particular during the
         heyday of classical literary narratology. For scholars like Genette (1988) and Cohn
         (1999), the category of the fictional narrator was at the centre of theoretical debates
         about the demarcation of fiction and non-fiction. Arguably, theorising about the fictional
         narrator necessitates theorising about fiction in general. From this, it follows that
         any account on which the fictional narrator is built ideally would be a theory of
         fiction compatible with all types of fictional narrative media – not just narrative
         fiction like novels and short stories.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In this vein, this paper applies a transmedial approach to the question of fictional
         narrators in different media based on the transmedial theory of fiction in terms of
         make-believe by Kendall Walton (1990). Although the article shares roughly the same
         theoretical point of departure as Köppe and Stühring, that is, an analytical-philosophical
         theory of fiction as make-believe, it offers a diametrically different solution. Building
         on the distinction between direct and indirect fictional truths as developed by Kendall
         Walton in his seminal theory of fiction as make-believe (1990), this paper proposes
         the fictional presence of a narrator in all fictional narratives. Importantly, ›presence‹
         in terms of being part of a work of fiction needs to be understood as exactly that:
         <span style="font-style:italic">fictional</span> presence, meaning that the question of what counts as a fictional truth is of great
         importance. Here, the distinction between direct and indirect fictional truths is
         crucial since not every fictional narrative – not even every literary fictional narrative –
         makes it directly fictionally true that it is narrated. To exemplify: not every novel
         begins with words like »Call me Ishmael«, i. e., stating direct fictional truths about
         its narrator. Indirect, implied fictional truths can also be part of the generation
         of the fictional truth of a fictional narrator. Therefore, the paper argues that every
         fictional narrative makes it (at least indirectly) fictionally true that it is narrated.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">More specifically, the argument is made that any theory of fictional narrative that
         accepts fictional narrators in some cases (as e. g. suggested by proponents of the
         so-called optional narrator theory, such as Currie [2010]), has to accept fictional
         narrators in all cases of fictional narratives. The only other option is to remove
         the category of fictional narrators altogether. Since the category of the fictional
         narrator has proved to be extremely useful in the history of narratology, such removal
         would be unfortunate, however. Instead, a solution is suggested that emphasizes the
         active role of recipients in the generation of fictional truths, and in particular
         in the generation of implied fictional truths.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Once the narratological category of the fictional narrator is understood in terms
         of fictional truth, the methodological consequences can be fully grasped: without
         the generation of fictional 
         <!--
                       p. -->truths in a game of make-believe, there are no fictional narratives – and no fictional
         narrators. The fictionality of narratives depends entirely on the fact that they are
         used as props in a game of make-believe. If they are not used in this manner, they
         are nothing but black dots on paper, the oxidation of silver through light, or any
         other technical description of artefacts containing representations. Fictional narrators
         are always based on fictional truths, they are the result of a game of make-believe,
         and hence the only evidence for a fictional narrator is always merely fictional. If
         it is impossible to imagine that the fictional work is narrated, then the work is
         not a narrative.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the first part of the paper, common arguments for and against the fictional narrator
         are discussed, such as the analytical, realist, transmedial, and the so-called evidence
         argument; in addition, unreliable narration in fictional film will be an important
         part in the defence of the ubiquitous fictional narrator in fictional narrative. If
         the category of unreliable narration relies on the interplay of both author, narration,
         and reader, the question of unreliable narration within narrative fiction that is
         not traditionally verbal, such as fiction films, becomes highly problematic. Based
         on Walton’s theory of make-believe, part two of the paper presents a number of reasons
         why at least implied fictional narrators are necessary for the definition of fictional
         narrative in different media and discusses the methodological consequences of this
         theoretical choice.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">Full-length article in: JLT 10/1 (2016), 38–57.</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Hermeneutics has for a long time been the central philosophical approach informing
         the study of the humanities. This has, however, in the eyes of some, isolated the
         study of humanities from the study of nature. My primary claim is that the commonly
         perceived divorce between the natural sciences and humanities rests on faulty theories
         of both scientific methodology and the nature of explanation and interpretation as
         defended by prior schools of philosophy such as hermeneutics. In this paper I argue
         that it is time to reconsider the humanities and to base research in the humanities
         on a philosophical approach that rests its claims on naturalized and pragmatic considerations.
         Such a naturalistic view reflects not only the practice of this research better than
         hermeneutics, but brings the aims of scientific study of cultural phenomena in closer
         contact with the aims we find in the scientific study of natural phenomena.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The article thus gives a naturalized account of the humanities by focusing on the
         similarities between the scientific practices within the natural sciences and the
         human sciences. Hence, I take issue with Hans-Georg Gadamer’s view that understanding
         always involves interpretation. I also deny that understanding is associated with
         linguistic meaning and that all understanding is historically determined. In much
         recent literature the analysis of interpretation presented by the postmodernist schools
         has exacerbated this situation with its mistaken doctrine that understanding rests
         on interpretation in both the natural sciences and the human sciences. In contrast,
         I hold that understanding is a cognitive organization of information and beliefs.
         Such a conception opens up for the attribution of understanding to other beings apart
         from humans. Animals, just as humans, possess instinctive and acquired understanding
         without being involved in any act of interpretation. I also maintain that even if
         we isolate reflective understanding to human beings, this still does not give us reason
         to hold that all understanding is the immediate result of an interpretation. For instance,
         experiencing the world around us or reading a simple text often does not engage us
         in an interpretation of what we see or read. This is something we comprehend directly
         whenever we have acquired the relevant concepts in virtue of which we grasp our daily
         life.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In contrast to the hermeneutic tradition I present a model of interpretation which,
         I believe, can bridge the much decried divorce between the disciplines leading to
         a unified view of the natural sciences and the human sciences. Interpretation, as
         I understand it, is an active cognitive procedure by which we attempt to solve a representational
         problem in cases where we don’t have any immediate comprehension. We have no such
         immediate grasp of the matter if what we see or read doesn’t fit into our background
         beliefs and knowledge. The purpose of interpretation is to yield understanding of
         what something – taken to represent something else – actually is representing, or
         how something unfamiliar might be represented. Thus an interpretation is the creation
         of either a hypothesis in virtue of which we explain what something symbolizes, stands
         for, designates, refers to, etc., or a hypothesis in virtue of which we construct
         a way of grasping an unknown phenomenon. In both cases the interpreter or the audience,
         or both, would gain an insight into something that was not understood prior to the
         interpretation.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->The above explication of interpretation and understanding paves the way for a unified
         approach to both the natural sciences and the humanities. If understanding is nothing
         but an organism’s organization of information and beliefs, then it seems quite evident
         that the empirical methods for gaining understanding in the natural sciences cannot
         be different from those we must use to acquire understanding in the humanities. The
         evolution by natural selection has established in our predecessors a disposition to
         detect false beliefs and stick to true beliefs. Humans are by nature intentional beings
         that learn from their cognitive successes and cognitive failures. So the justification
         of the use of empirical methods in the humanities as well as in the natural sciences
         is that these methods are grounded in a certain innate cognitive practice of belief
         acquisition. The capacity of learning is based on the cognitive mechanism of induction,
         and the modern specification of various types of empirical methods are abstracted
         and generalized from our mind’s reflection upon the cognitive practice that rests
         on this mechanism.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In opposition to Dilthey and his school, Gadamer claimed that the humanities were
         not unique in demanding the use of methods different than those used in the natural
         sciences. However, he argued that objective interpretation of a text was not within
         the range of literary study. His reason for saying so was that any interpretation
         is bounded by a historical perspective and that the author’s intention has no role
         to play in an interpreter’s interpretation of a literary text. I believe he is wrong.
         I argue that Gadamer ignored a distinction between the act and the topic of interpretation.
         All interpreters are situated in a historical context and their interpretive hypotheses
         may be coloured by the existence of such a context. But if the topic of one’s interpretive
         hypotheses is the author’s intentions, which exist independently of hypothesis itself,
         and if one uses adequate evidence and empirical methods to justify these interpretations,
         the resulting insight will be as objective as something can be. Therefore, I conclude
         that a naturalistic stance to the humanities is superior to any hermeneutic stance.

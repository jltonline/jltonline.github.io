      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext" lang="de" translate="no">In his paper in <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">JLT</span>, Barry Stampfl deals with mental creativity, »moving away from the disease/disorder/deficit
         model that is implicit in our usual definitions« of trauma (Stampfl 2012, 130). However,
         a trauma according to the main theorists is simply not a disease: The textbook by
         Fischer and Riedesser is often cited in the papers.<span id="Note2_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Although not in the newest edition of 2009, cf. Anastasiadis 2012, 23, and Boothe/Thoma 2012, 38." href="#Note2">[2]</a></span> It defines a traumatic experience as a »vitales Diskrepanzerlebnis zwischen bedrohlichen
         Situationsfaktoren und den individuellen Bewältigungsmöglichkeiten, das mit Gefühlen
         von Hilflosigkeit und schutzloser Preisgabe einhergeht und so eine dauerhafte Erschütterung
         von Selbst- und Weltverständnis bewirkt« (Fischer/Riedesser 2009, 395).<span id="Note3_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="»The experience of a vital discrepancy between certain threatening elements of one situation and the possibility of coping with this situation in con…" href="#Note3">[3]</a></span> A person is exhausted in a special situation and cannot cope with this very situation
         which in his or her eyes is life-threatening. The reaction is natural, but the after-effects

These after-effects may in <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">some</span> cases (<span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">not in all</span>, depending on the resources of the victim) cause a <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">PTSD</span> (a Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, and »Post« means <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">after</span> the traumatic incident).

                       p. -->PTSD</span> is a new phenomenon, the term was first used in 1980, it is not a timeless entity,
         it is »a historical construct that has been glued together by the practices, technologies,

         by the various interests, institutions, and moral arguments that mobilized these efforts
         and resources« (Alan Young in Leys 2000, 6).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This seems to be a static definition, a reification of the phenomena, as Hanna puts
         it in his critic on trauma-theoretical approaches in general.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext">[The] phenomena which would be more precisely and profoundly accounted for as dynamic
         processes, context-dependant, interpersonal relations, and so on, are reified as being
         static, isolated, natural, inherent, concrete, and so on. […] The reifications are
         not so much erroneous contents of thought but rather are erroneous thought-forms (which
         then of course distorts the content). […] the main problematic result of reification
         is that it creates a misleading oversimplification of phenomena, and then this misunderstanding
         tends to substitute for more rigorous analysis of the phenomena. […] when a reification
         becomes common coin, further analysis of the phenomena drops out; the reification
         serves as an ersatz [a substitute] for thinking. […] reification therefore serves
         the general function of making socially determined relations seem like inevitable
         natural realities.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext">(Hanna 2003, 40–45)</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext"><span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">PTSD</span> seems to impose a monocausal connection on a certain event and a reaction of a person.
         Fischer and Riedesser try to avoid this reification: Modern trauma theory in their
         sense explains a trauma as a dialectical relation between a single situation and the
         resources of a single victim. Irrespective of this, even <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">PTSD</span> is a disorder, but not a disease, it is a normal response to stress. The <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">DSM-IV</span> (the major »Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders«) states that a
         <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">PTSD</span> is »the development of characteristic symptoms following exposure to an extreme traumatic
         stressor involving direct personal [!] experience that involves actual or threatened
         death or serious injury, or other threats to one’s [!] physical integrity« (DSM-IV
         2005, 435). This definition was slightly changed in the DSM-5 in 2013 (»exposure to
         one or more traumatic events«) along with the elimination of the subjective reaction
         as a criterion, but stresses the individual character of the experience even more:
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext">The directly experienced traumatic events […] include, but are not limited to, exposure
         to war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual physical assault (e. g. physical
         attack, robbery, mugging, childhood physical abuse), threatened or actual sexual violence
         […], being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration
         as a prisoner of war, natural or human-made disasters, and severe motor vehicle accidents.
         […] Witnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened or serious
         injury, unnatural death, physical or sexual abuse of another person due to violent
         assault, domestic violence, accident, war or disaster, or a medical catastrophe in
         one’s child […]. Indirect exposure through learning about an event is limited to affecting
         close relatives or friends and experiences that are violent or accidental […]. The
         traumatic event can be experienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual [!] has
         recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive recollections of the event […]. Individuals
         [!] with PTSD may be quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive verbal and/or
         physical behavior with little or no provocation. […] PTSD can occur at any age, beginning
         after the first year of life.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In short, there simply is no »disease/disorder/deficit model that is implicit in our
         [!] usual definitions«, as Stampfl puts it. What is his problem?
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">First of all we have to differentiate between an acute trauma and a <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">PTSD</span>, a posttraumatic stress disorder, which develops, »wenn ein Trauma – oder viele Traumata

         (Reddemann 2011, 21).<span id="Note4_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="»[...] if a trauma – or many traumata – could not be assimilated or handled«." href="#Note4">[4]</a></span><span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">PTSD</span> is not a trauma, but a <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">PTSD</span> can occur after a trauma, it <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">can</span> occur depending on the very person and its resources.

      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext">The fear generated by a threat is relieved not by attempts to reestablish harmony
         with the threatener or to negotiate (or to »reason«) with it in some way; the fear
         is relieved by aggression which seeks to control the situation or destroy the threat.
         This fear/aggression response can be found in all mammals and all reptiles because
         it is seated in the most primitive sectors of the limbic system. So in Man, this fear/aggression
         conversion mechanism is, phylogenetically considered, archaic.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The alternatives are fight or flight. If it is impossible to fight or flee (you are
         too weak or the opponent is too powerful), freezing might be a good solution. Freezing
         in no-fight-no-flight-situations may help you to survive. However, freezing has certain
         effects: To freeze while being tortured might be a good way to survive this very situation,
         but to freeze every time you see somebody wearing a white collar similar to the one
         the torturer was wearing would be difficult in normal life.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">as the trauma therapist Michaela Huber puts it: To freeze means to stay motionless,
         and to fragment means to split up the mind (for example to forget the event). So,
         a traumatic reaction is a perfect tool to survive in a life-threatening situation.
         It is not a disease – but with possibly bad after-effects for <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">some</span> people: That is why horizontal and vertical dissociation of the mind (and <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">not</span> the vertical repression of memories in the Freudian sense) is a good technique to
         survive.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The reaction is natural, the disturbance is overwhelming. That is why trauma therapists
         try not to blame the victim: The victim is not sick. The victim did the right thing.
         And the later reactions (intrusions, lost memories, flashbacks, nightmares, hyperarousal,
         reenactment) are normal reactions, too. Nevertheless, it might be good to have a look
         at these after-effects. Is the victim still in a life-threatening situation? If not,
         it might be possible to think of changing these normal, but burdening reactions. And
         it is possible to change these reactions to a certain degree depending on the resources
         of the victim. That is why it is the main task of trauma therapy to strengthen the
         resources: A trauma therapy consists of six parts, as Arne Hofmann states: »Stabilisierung,
         Stabiliserung, Stabilisierung, Stabilisierung, Traumakonfrontation sowie Trauer und
         Neubeginn« (quoted in Reddemann 2003, 23).<span id="Note6_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="»Stabilization, stabilization, stabilization, stabilization, confrontation with the trauma as well as grief and a new start«." href="#Note6">[6]</a></span> As the American trauma therapist Peter A. Levine puts it: »A trauma is not a Disease,
         but a Dis-ease« (Levine 1996, 33).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">That is why one should be careful not to mix up one’s own problems with trauma (maybe
         you cannot bear descriptions of extreme suffering) with the normal reaction of a person
         to a life-threatening situation. Don’t blame the victim because of your own reactions
         to suffering.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Devereux in his famous <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">From Anxiety to Method in Behavioural Science</span> calls this sort of reaction »counter-transference« (1967, 44) while using a term
         widely known in psychoanalysis. Freud understands counter-transference as a result
         of the patient’s influence on the therapist’s unconscious feelings. As Devereux claims,
         anyone who studies frightening material »seeks to protect himself against anxiety
         by the omission, soft-pedalling, non-exploitation, misunderstanding, ambiguous description,
         over-exploitation or rearrangement of certain parts of his material« (ibid.). This
         is what Stampfl did in his paper.

         <!--
                       p. -->1.2. Flashbacks, False Memory, and Sequential Traumatisation
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In her paper in <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">JLT</span>, Susanna Onega cites a paragraph from a novel in which somebody depicts his experiences
         in a sort of stream of consciousness. She calls this a »flashback« (Onega 2012, 93).
         Is a stream-of-consciousness-narration a flashback? A flashback is a »plötzliches
         intensives Wahrnehmen von Trauma-Bestandteilen mit Wiedererlebensqualität« (Huber
         2003, 69).<span id="Note7_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="»[...] a sudden and intense realization of parts of the trauma with a quality of living through it again«." href="#Note7">[7]</a></span> Somebody is triggered by a fragmented detail and lives through an old situation as
         vividly as if it were a real situation. He or she does not actually remember a situation
         (»O yes, it was like this and that and started then and then ended like that!«), but
         he or she is in the situation again. He or she re-enacts the authentic experience.
         Onega does not describe a flashback but an effort to describe such a situation via
         a stream-of-consciousness-narration.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">On the same page Onega speaks of a person who was »not the victim of punctual trauma
         caused by a concrete overwhelming event« but »of terrible things that have happened
         to him repeatedly throughout his life, that is, he belongs to the Freudian category
         of trauma victim who has been in ›shock‹ most of one’s life« (ibid.). I failed to
         find any source in Freud’s work for this assertion. And what about her ›one event
         – one trauma‹? Trauma does not inevitably mean only one single event – even not for
         Freud (see page 173 seq. in this paper). The psychoanalyst Hans Keilson made a longitudinal
         analysis of Dutch Jewish children who survived the occupation and the persecution
         by the Nazis and who experienced a chain of traumatisations. His <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Sequentielle Traumatisierung bei Kindern</span> (1979) was ignored for quite a long time even by professional trauma therapists,
         but was reprinted in 2005. His book is very interesting for any scholar because in
         this now famous longitudinal analysis he retells the life-stories of many children
         with sequential traumatisation, that means with retraumatisations as a repetition
         of the base-trauma reopening the old wounds over and over again.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Surprisingly, scholars always try to go back to Freud and ignore the works of Masud
         Kahn (cumulative trauma) or Keilson (sequential traumatisation). They go back to Freud
         because they seem to be interested only in the single event (see the papers of Anastasiadis,
         Onega, Staniliou and Markowitsch in <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">JLT</span>). In the case of trauma this is a thing one should be careful with. In Onega’s case,
         knowledge of Keilson would have been of value.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Let’s have a look at another example: Athanasios Anastasiadis mentions a woman, who
         »quite obviously has <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">false memories</span> or <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">pseudo memories</span>« (Anastasiadis 2012, 15). He explains that certain »aspects of her memories do not
         correspond to any actually experienced events« (ibid.). First of all, this implies
         that all memories correspond one to one to real events, which is plainly wrong as
         a cursory look on works on memory by Daniel Schacter or Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel
         would have shown. Leaving this aside, in the discussion about false memories nobody
         has ever questioned which aspects of memories are ›right‹ or ›wrong‹. The point is
         that without further investigation one cannot differentiate between adequate and wrong,
         long-lost, and now remembered memories of sexual abuse in early childhood at all.
         As Phil Mollon puts it:
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext">There are no known methods of reliably enhancing memory. Attempts to do so run the
         risk of yielding confabulated or false memories […]. Without objective corroboration,
         it may be impossible to determine whether a recovered memory – that is, an experience
         that had been firmly forgotten and then later remembered – is essentially true or
         is a product of imagination.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext">(Mollon 2000, 68)</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The question is not: Are memories right or wrong? The question is: Should memories
         that have been forgotten and then later were recovered be treated as real memories
         when it is impossible to differentiate between real and false memory without further
         investigation? Real 
         <!--
                       p. -->memories are not more vivid or more detailed or more impressive than false memories.
         To speak of ›false‹ memories as pseudo memories is simply wrong.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">One may think that this critic is narrow-minded. Let’s have a look at some other aspects.</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">As mentioned before, one should be careful when citing Freud. Why is that so? Psychoanalysis
         is a theory based on assumptions. It is based on experiences, inductivity and theoretical
         assertions. Freud was unhappy about not having hard scientific data on the brain to
         back up his theory. But trauma-theoretical approaches are different: They have a scientific
         background, for example magnetic resonance imaging. Of course, magnetic resonance
         imaging is not the master solution for all problems: It is only an indirect confirmation
         for some assumptions on activities taking place in the brain. It is always indirect,
         because we cannot see thoughts themselves, but only the rise of activity in some parts
         of the brain, and we can draw conclusions from that. However, as a result of this
         scientific background, a shift took place in talking about trauma.

         broadened this tendency to non-observance of external events, which often ended in
         half-cooked and even wrong explanations of neurotic symptoms only based on inner dispositions
         (cf. Fischer/Riedesser 2009, 40). This may lead to a »Verabsolutierung des Intrapsychischen«,
         a »reduktive[r] Intrapsychismus« (Fischer 2005, 143)<span id="Note10_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="»[...] a dogmatisation of the intra-psyche«, a »reductive ›intra-psychism‹«." href="#Note10">[10]</a></span> – or a reification, as Hanna calls this (2003, passim). All too often, scholars ignore
         this fact and start their inquiry with citing works of Freud (or Janet or Breuer or
         Charcot) without thinking about the consequences.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Why is this strategy so problematic? Let’s invent a case example: What would you think
         of a philosopher who wants to write an article about the different ways of understanding
         time in philosophy and limits her paper by saying that she will write about time in
         general, but her main interest is to reread the text of Augustines <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Confessiones</span> and ignore Kant’s <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Critique of Pure Reason</span> and Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity? To ignore such major changes would make
         for a very odd paper.<span id="Note11_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Compare this with Bronfen 1999, concentrating only on Freud." href="#Note11">[11]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Let’s presume the paper becomes influential. Now, everybody who wants to take part
         in the main discourse about time will have to cite it. The interest in reading Kant
         and Einstein will decline. On the other hand, only a few will read Augustine to think
         of Augustine’s texts in a new and provoking way which may position the author of the
         new paper outside of the main discourse. In the end, nobody reads Kant and Einstein
         (or others), and nobody rereads Augustine, because citing the influential paper seems
         to be sufficient.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Unfortunately, according to research into trauma theory and literature, the situation
         is even more complex: There seem to be no other psychological theoretical approaches
         to literature than psychoanalytical approaches in the Freudian sense.<span id="Note12_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Compare the textbooks of Kimmich and others (2008, 147 sqq.), Schmid (2009, 266 sqq.), and Eder and others (2010, 5)." href="#Note12">[12]</a></span> That is why the reproaches sound so familiar: to understand works of art as symptoms,
         to turn the artist into a patient (to »put him on the couch«), or to understand a
         character as a real person (see Fischer 2005, 19).These 
         <!--

         can be observed does not offer a new interpretation, it does not improve one’s knowledge
         of a piece of art: It is an »undialectical« interpretation of a piece of art, as Fischer
         would call it (Fischer 2005, 11 and passim):

         you might get into trouble in <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">not</span> citing Freud.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Is Freud always right? The question misses the point. Modern trauma theory is different:
         If the stressor is strong enough, even healthy people with no experience of sexual
         abuse in early childhood or other early traumatic experiences can become traumatised.<span id="Note16_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="That is the reason why you might get difficulties in saving Freud at all costs, as Prager 1998, 156, did: »The wartime events evoke the prerepresenta…" href="#Note16">[16]</a></span> That is why the new approach does not use the notion of the Freudian vertical repression
         (»Unterdrückung«) but of vertical and horizontal dissociation (the splitting-up of
         memories). According to modern trauma theory, trauma is not a deliberate pushing-down,
         but a moving aside of reality in a life-threatening situation. So, the difference
         between Freud and modern trauma theory is a qualitative difference that cannot be
         bridged so easily: Trauma theory is not a culturally dependant theory like Freud’s
         psychoanalysis, another way of hermeneutics, or a deconstructionist or postmodern
         view. Rather, it is based upon anthropological constants, like (neurobiological) reactions,
         or the alteration of the behaviour of one person not only due to sexual abuse in early
         childhood or the loss of one’s mother, but due to a »life-threatening or violent event«
         such as »war, terrorism, torture, natural disasters, accidents, violence or rape«
         (Shiromani et al. 2009, v).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Additionally, there is and always has been a solid understanding of reactions based
         on death-like situations and mortal fear which does not depend on a special frame
         like <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</span> (<span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">PTSD) </span>or <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Disorder of Extreme Stress Not Otherwise Specified</span> (<span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">DESNOS</span>, see DSM-IV<span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">)</span>, sequential traumatisation, cumulative traumatisation, flashback, etc. We are able
         to analyse older texts (as the Bible or Shakespeare) and use trauma theory because
         the texts deal with anthropological constants. Neurobiological terminology might help
         to understand such phenomena in a better way (memories of traumatic experiences are
         stored in the brain a-causally and a-temporally), but as an end in itself neurobiological
         talk does not help in any way.<span id="Note17_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="On the seductive allure of neuroscientific explanations see Weisberg et al. 2008." href="#Note17">[17]</a></span> One should always keep in mind: We are talking about anthropological constants of
         reactions on death-like experiences that turned someone’s view of the world upside
         down, and as for all mammals these reactions are: fight, flight or freeze, and they
         always have been.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Moreover, there is one fundamental difference between the way the Freudian school
         understands the role of a therapist and the way most of the trauma therapists think
         of this role today. Freud’s repression-theory regards trauma as an encapsulation that
         can only be resolved by a psychoanalyst. So the trauma seems to be immutable without
         the help of the therapist. Modern trauma theory is different. As the German psychiatrist
         Ulrich Sachsse puts it:

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This stands opposite to many statements of scholars and trauma-theoretic approaches
         which try to enjoin on a victim what he is capable and incapable of.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Most of these trauma theorists speak of »<span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">the</span> trauma« – which is a dangerous thing to do. And even worse, they speak of traumatised
         people as a consistent group. Here are some examples from the papers in <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">JLT</span>: »They unknowingly pass on their unresolved traumas to the second and third generation«
         (Anastasiadis 2012, 4; that means: <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">everybody</span> does this without knowing, and <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">all</span> the traumata are unresolved); »Können aber die Überlebenden der nationalsozialistischen
         Lager ein persönliches Bezugssystem erzählend gelten machen?« (Boothe/Thoma 2012,
         26; that means: <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">all</span> the survivors).<span id="Note19_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="»But can all the survivors of the Nazi-Camps bring a personal frame of reference to bear?«" href="#Note19">[19]</a></span> Bourgeois coldness appears in some of these generalizing sentences: Onega claims
         that »trauma victims are caught in the dilemma of having to choose between the stigmatisation
         of madness and social exclusion, or integration in the group at the cost of hiding
         their scars and mitigating the atrocity of their experiences« (Onega 2012, 87, <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">all</span> the victims). She seems to state that a victim with <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">PTSD</span> is able to choose to conceal the wounds on his own or not – and that such a concealment
         (if it is possible at all) is the same as being accepted in society. If it was that
         easy!
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Speaking of »the trauma« and »the victims« while ignoring the single case is dangerous:
         Jeffrey Prager in his <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Presenting the Past. Psychoanalysis and the Sociology of Misremembering</span> states that our »society is currently in an assault on subjectivity itself, eager
         to replace a focus on the interpretative, meaning-making, symbolizing self with a
         focus on history and its determinative impact upon individuals« (1998, 132). In short:
         It is a reification.

         theory of language«, as Leys 2009, 275, claims). As Susana Onega puts it in her paper
         in <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">JLT</span>, Caruth »attempted a thorough transposition of Paul de Man’s notion of linguistic
         slippage to the structure of trauma« (Onega 2012, 88). This is at least surprising:
         Why does Caruth rely on Freud and Lacan, who were interested in healing persons through
         the use of language – and goes in the opposite direction in stating that language
         is unable to help at all? And what has Paul de Man to do with trauma anyhow?
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In a fascinating paper, Sharon Rosenberg writes about her disillusions about »the
         kind of scholarly subject in performance demanded by the modern university« (Rosenberg
         2010, 250). She writes about a new ignorance trauma induces. She worries »that trauma
         and memory studies are being too readily incorporated into the normative and hegemonic
         projects of modern university« (ibid., 259). She describes a dilemma of dealing with
         trauma, »not to read [it] as a problem to be solved (it cannot be) but as one that
         demands from its practitioners creative risk in thought and practice« (ibid., 252).
         A solution could be to get rid of certain theoretical approaches – but Rosenberg is
         unable to do that. On the contrary, she tries to save the theory at all costs using
         mantra-like expressions, such as: »[I]f we follow Felman, Simon and Ellsworth through
         Lacan […]« and »[I]f we follow Caruth through Freud [...]«. It does 
         <!--
                       p. -->not occur to her that the problem might be Caruth and the others. I would call this
         an <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">idée fixe</span>, because Rosenberg seems to be caught in a vicious circle. One might ask: What are
         the benefits? What are the costs? Do we really need de Man to understand anything
         better? And what about Caruth herself? In Onega’s references in her paper in <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">JLT </span>Kansteiner and Weilnböck’s powerful criticism of Caruth in their contribution to the
         international and interdisciplinary handbook <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Culture Memory Studies</span> is not even mentioned. Moreover, Onega cites Lacan, who »defined the traumatic as
         a missed encounter with the real« (Onega 2012, 85). A »missed« encounter? According
         to any definition of a traumatic experience, a traumatisation is not a missed, but
         it is an overwhelming encounter. So why should anybody cite Lacan?

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Citing an authority (»a good name«) means to take part in a discourse, to borrow some
         of the power of the discourse to make your own argument more convincing. This may
         lead to problems: Remember <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Fashionable Nonsense. Postmodern Intellectual’s Abuse of Science</span> by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont, published in 1998. Their book dealt with »mystification,
         deliberately obscure language, confused thinking, and the misuse of scientific concepts«
         (1998, xi). They listed some rules to escape the dangers of misuse of science: »It’s
         a good idea to know what one’s talking about«; »Not all that is obscure is necessarily
         profound«; »Science is not a text« (which means that the sciences are »not a mere
         reservoir of metaphors ready to be used in the human sciences«); – and: »Be wary of
         argument from authority« (ibid., 185–187). They give reasons why a special way of
         use (or misuse) became so popular. In their eyes, it was the neglect of the empirical
         combined with using the prestige of the natural sciences as a means to an end and
         a special »traditional philosophical and literary training« (ibid., 190, 193).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This sounds familiar: Kansteiner and Weilnböck list up »five fundamental, interrelated
         problems« for postmodern trauma theory. Firstly a »vague, metaphorical concept of
         trauma, which equates the concrete suffering of victims of violence with ontological
         questions«, secondly a »surprising lack of interdisciplinary curiosity«, thirdly a
         »similarly disturbing disinterest in the empirical research on media effects« of trauma,
         then an »almost paranoid fear of narratives based on the axiom that all narration
         has distorting and normalizing effects and thus destroys the fundamental pre-narrative
         insights revealed by trauma«, and finally a »valorization and aesthetization of trauma,
         high art and philosophy as sites of intangible, ethereal authenticity« (Kansteiner
         and Weilnböck 2008, 237).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">All these problems can be found in the papers in <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">JLT</span>. The lack of self-critical reflection is astonishing. On the contrary, in these papers
         you often find the same sort of broadening one concept with a very different theory
         which has nothing to do with trauma in exactly the same way as Caruth did with de
         Man: Onega tries to explain the »achronicity and chaotic arrangement« of a certain
         text (2012, 89) with Walter Benjamin’s concept of constellation. Is there a benefit
         in using Benjamin’s notion? And Stampfl uses in his paper about »Traumatic Creativity«
         Peirce’s ›Abductive Inference‹:<span id="Note21_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Peirce is a well known figure in literary theory, see for example Packard 2006." href="#Note21">[21]</a></span> In the traumatic experience when all the learned strategies fail one has to adopt
         new ways of dealing with something similar to abductive inference. Why doesn’t he
         refer to Jakob von Uexküll or Umberto Maturana? Constructivist thinking has always
         played a major role in trauma theory (cf. for example Fischer/Riedesser 2009, 78 sqq.),
         but not Peirce. Why should anyone cite Peirce at all?

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">1.5. Trauma as a Collective Phenomenon</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The enlargement of the notion of trauma by Caruth and others tries to get rid of the
         single overwhelming event, tries to avoid the single traumatisation of one person.
         This seems to be a 
         <!--
                       p. -->reification, the founding of a generalizing, static, new concept. If different clinical
         definitions of trauma or <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">PTSD</span> are taken seriously, there cannot be anything like a collective trauma. Keane defines
         <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">PTSD</span> according to the <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">DSM</span> as a phenomenon that stems from an event »in which one [!] is exposed to a serious
         threat of injury or death and then experiences extreme fear, helplessness, or horror«
         (Keane et al. 2009, 2). A single person is exhausted in a special situation and cannot
         cope with a situation that in his or her eyes is threatening his or her life. That
         is why a whole people, nation, or generation can never be such a single person with
         specific properties.<span id="Note22_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="For this culture-as-person-metaphor see DeRosa 2012, 47." href="#Note22">[22]</a></span> On the other hand, there is a strong need to label groups as traumatised. How can
         collective traumata be compared with one another? Which categories should be used?
         As a matter of fact, how can the subsuming of different destinies to one collective
         trauma do justice to the individual experience (cf. Kühner 2007, 24)? And how can
         we escape the dangers of reification? However, it might be very interesting for a
         single traumatised person to embed his or her own single experience in a history shared
         by others: What happened to me is systematic, is part of a collective experience (cf.
         ibid., 25). Now, the question is: Do we really need the notion of trauma when we talk
         about collective experiences? The DSM-5 highlights some restrictions when defining
         Posttraumatical Stress Disorder (<span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">PTSD</span>): »Indirect exposure through learning about an event is limited to affecting close
         relatives or friends and experiences that are violent or accidental […].« (DSM-5 2013,
         274)
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The psychologist Barbara Kühner differentiates between <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">collective traumata</span>, <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">collectivized traumata,</span> and <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">traumata that are collectively mediated via symbols</span>. Her first concept, <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">collective trauma</span>, concentrates on the traumatisations which were experienced in reality, for example
         a mass-trauma. Her second concept, <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">collectivized trauma</span>, stresses the process with which a shared event becomes part of the collective identity
         of a group. Her third concept concentrates on the part of the collective which is
         not traumatised in a narrow sense: The collective is heavily shocked due to the closeness
         to and partial identification with the victim via symbolisation (ibid., 27). Her differentiation
         is helpful, because the idea of a collective trauma may help a single person not to
         feel left alone. On the other hand, the expansion of the approach may result in oversimplification
         and generalization of experiences which cannot be generalized at all.

         and invulnerability, which has nothing to do with trauma or even with collective traumata.
         Do we need the concept of trauma in this big picture? Hans-Jürgen Wirth supposes that
         narcissism, power, and paranoia played important roles in the second war against Iraq.
         The national identity of America was damaged because of a narcissistic humiliation

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">1.6. Trauma as the Hidden Sacred: a Gesture of Bourgeois Coldness</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In connection with the notion ›collective trauma‹ it became clear that moral intuitions
         play an important role when dealing with trauma. If we have a look at literature written
         by traumatised people, should this kind of literature be dealt with a different approach?
         In this case, there is an underlying motivation at work: It shows the need for moral
         regulations.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">For Caruth, the traumatic experience is inexplicable per se. Nobody should try to
         verbalize these horrible experiences, otherwise the uniqueness of these experiences
         will be degraded. This is an anti-Freudian statement, as I mentioned earlier (see
         page 177 seq.). She claims that »the possibility of integration into memory and the
         consciousness of history thus raises the question ›whether it is not a sacrilege of
         the traumatic experience to play with reality of the past‹« (Caruth 1995, 154). And
         these traumata are infectious, that means, they have an afterlife: You do not have
         to experience a trauma to be traumatized. In generalizing this way, »trauma becomes
         unlocutable in any particular individual«, as Leys claims (Leys 2000, 17). What a
         twist – from an overwhelming situation for a single person with its special resources
         to something that nobody can talk about and which everybody has got!
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">As Caruth puts it, to integrate a trauma into memory is the same as playing a game
         and it is also a sacrilege: The historian Dominick LaCapra thinks that in this case,
         according to Caruth, »the real or literal traumatic, inaccessible and inherently incomprehensible
         or unrepresentable, [...] can be represented or addressed indirectly in figurative
         or allegorical terms that necessarily destroy and betray it«. He speculates, that
         »the further displacement (as well as distortion and disguise) involved here may be
         with respect to a variant of religion in which the Hidden God is radically transcendent,
         inscrutable (or unreadable), and, in a secular context, dead, invariable, lost or
         barred« (LaCapra 2001, 107–109, footnote). The consequences can easily be drawn: »All
         representations of such an absolute are sacrilegious or prohibited.« In the context
         of trauma, »trauma may itself be sacralized as a catastrophic revelation or, in more
         secular terms, be transvalued as the radical other or sublime« (ibid.). In contrast
         to Caruth, LaCapra distinguishes between <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">acting-out</span> (you just repeat things; Levine calls this »re-enactment«, cf. Levine 1997, 31) and
         <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">working-through</span> (in working-through you might be able to understand what has happened and you need
         not always have to act things out without noticing it). Of course, this is a Freudian
         concept (cf. for example his <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Erinnern, Wiederholen, Durcharbeiten</span>). Now, Caruth seems to forbid working-through, according to LaCapra:
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext">The difficulty is that this frame of reference may either foreclose any attempt to
         work through problems or immediately conflate the latter with necessarily Pollyanna
         or redemptive dialectical <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Aufhebung </span>[German in the original]<span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">.</span> By contrast, one may conceive of working through as a limited process of integration
         or introjection of the past which may never fully transcend the acting-out of trauma
         or achieve full integration and closure.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext">(ibid.)</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext" lang="de" translate="no">I would call Caruth’s view a perverse gesture of forbidding the traumatised to formulate
         her or his life story as an effort to cope with a traumatic experience. I would call
         this way of response a gesture of bourgeois coldness, as the educational theorist
         Andreas Gruschka puts it. He refers to Adorno’s <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Minima Moralia</span>, where Adorno attacks Hegel: »mit überlegener Kälte operiert er [Hegel] nochmals
         die Liquidation des Besonderen. Nirgends wird bei ihm das Primat des Ganzen bezweifelt«
         (Adorno 1984, 15).<span id="Note24_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="»With serene indifference he [Hegel] opts once again for liquidation of the particular.

         <!--
                       p. -->this reification, is responsible for bourgeois coldness, which shows itself in the
         thinker’s indifference towards the individual, as Gruschka states: »Kälte zeigt sich
         also insbesondere in der Indifferenz des Denkenden gegenüber dem Leben der je besonderen
         Menschen, in deren Subsumtion unter Prinzipien, die als verallgemeinernde ihnen Unrecht
         antun« (Gruschka 1994, 47).<span id="Note25_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="»Coldness shows itself especially in the indifference of the thinker on the life of the single human being in subsuming it under principles which per…" href="#Note25">[25]</a></span> In other words, restrictions and rules ignore the individual case.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In contrast to that, the individual case is the very subject matter of trauma theory.
         That is why Bronfen’s understanding of trauma as a »neues Deutungsmuster für Moderne
         und Modernität« (»a new pattern of interpretation for modern times and modernity«,
         Bronfen 1999, VII) is harmful, because trauma simply isn’t such a pattern. One thing
         is clear: Requirements for restrictions and regulations because of a special status
         of a special kind of literature have consequences.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext" lang="de" translate="no">Unfortunately, you might get the impression of an overwhelming moral pressure put
         on you if writing on trauma (cf. Fricke 2006, passim). Boothe and Thoma speak in their
         paper in <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">JLT</span> of the »erfahrene Qual«. This anguish becomes »zu einer, die alle Menschen gleich

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">1.8. Where is the Benefit?</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">If you have a look at the endings of some of the eight papers in <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">JLT</span>, you may be surprised about the outcome: »The texts under discussion share a further
         important common characteristic. The narrators transform their post-memory process
         into a novel, thus they produce and shape cultural memory« (Anastasiadis 2012, 22).
         »Die Untersuchung gibt Hinweise darauf, dass horrifizierende Extremerfahrungen der
         episodisch durchgestalteten Narrativierung zugänglich sind« (Boothe/Thoma 2012, 36).

         find the eggs in the basket which were hid in the beginning. There are few surprises
         and not much to be learnt. This may be because of the taking part in a new master
         narration called trauma: You just have to cite Freud, Lacan, Caruth, and others. Then
         you take part in the discourse, which seems to be sufficient. These interpretations
         only make sense, because such »reifications simply arise and circulate where they
         do because they ›make sense‹, i. e. they mesh with the given state of affairs and
         present no challenge to it« (Hanna 2003, 176).

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">2. Missing Interest in Authors and Characters</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">In the papers about trauma in <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">JLT</span>, one can observe a certain shyness in talking about fiction and characters. No paper
         tries to explain the behaviour of a fictitious character in a novel in 
         <!--
                       p. -->the light of trauma theory. When fiction is added, it is mostly for the sake of giving
         an example (»Look here! It is the same in fiction!«). However, there is no new interpretation
         to shed a new light on the text: The text stays unchanged, untouchable. Why is that
         so?
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Most literary theorists seem to be afraid of thinking of fictional characters as real
         characters,<span id="Note30_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="For a brief and helpful summary on this topic, see Eder et al. 2010 passim." href="#Note30">[30]</a></span> because the »reception of characters is quite different from the direct encounter
         with real people« (Eder et al. 2010, 11). Readers »cannot interact with the represented
         person but [only] can think about their meaning«, and »the symbolism and the communicative
         mediation of characters mark fundamental differences to the observation of persons
         in reality« (ibid.). Of course, fictional characters show »ontological incompleteness«
         (ibid.): They are not described in every detail. The colour of their hair, or the
         shape of their fingers might not be specified in the text, and in a film you might
         not know the exact number of children the character has. As a matter of fact, characters
         are always incomplete. However, this is the same with real people. We know a lot about
         our friends – but do we know everything?<span id="Note31_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. Stolorow and Atwood on the myth of the isolated single mind: They prefer to talk of intersubjectivity which »brings to focus both the individual’…" href="#Note31">[31]</a></span> Two salient questions come up: Why are theorists afraid of characters at all, and
         why do readers like them?
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">2.1. Literary Research and Problems with Fictional Characters</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">As mentioned before, Eder and others only mention »psychoanalytic approaches« (Eder
         et al. 2010, 5) when discussing literary psychology. These approaches try to explain
         »the inner life of characters, as well as the reactions of viewers, users, and readers,
         with the help of psychodynamic-models of personality (e. g., those developed by Freud
         and Lacan)«. If we want to »understand the text, film etc. in its historical context,
         we need to find out about the psychological and anthropological knowledge <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">that was available to the author and her or his contemporaries</span>« (ibid., 12, my emphasis).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">If this is taken seriously, any interpretation of any older text which uses a trauma
         theoretical approach is false because the author simply could not have read Fischer
         and Riedesser’s handbook. This »Anti-Psycholgismus« (counter-psychologism) just allows
         »einen Beschreibungs- und keinen Erklärungsanspruch« (a right to describe, not a right
         to explain, Weilnböck 2007, 23): The work of art has to stay autonomous, inexplicable
         and sacrosanct at its very core. This is very unconvincing, to say the least.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Weilnböck describes two main areas in literature which depend on a certain psychological
         logic, because first of all, characters were invented by an author who used all of
         his inexplicit and explicit knowledge about the emotional setup of people and their
         ways of reacting, and secondly, the psyche of the character must be refreshed or actualised
         and mentally adopted by the reader. That means: »Fiktionale Figuren existieren gar
         nicht eigentlich außerhalb von menschlichen Psychen und menschlichen Prozessen der
         mentalen (Re-)Konstruktion, die in AutorInnen und LeserInnen ablaufen [...]« (ibid.).<span id="Note32_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="»Fictional characters do not exist outside of human psyches and human processes of mental (re-)construction which take part in authors and readers at…" href="#Note32">[32]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext" lang="de" translate="no">This is just one side of the medal: To try to forbid psychological interpretation
         does not only exclude the reader and the author, it asserts that fictional characters
         are different per se. This is a sign of an »erstaunliche epistemologische Naivität
         [...], mit der davon ausgegangen wird, man könne die Aussagen einer empirischen Person
         ›definitiv‹ verifizieren, während für ›fiktive Gestalten‹ ein Status der ›prinzipiellen
         Indeterminiterheit‹ gelte« (ibid., 25).<span id="Note33_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="»It is an astonishing epistemological naïveté to claim that the statements of an empirical person can be verified ›definitely‹, whereas for fictitiou…" href="#Note33">[33]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Is trauma theory limited to certain times in history and to special sorts of texts?
         Surprisingly, this seems to be the case: Holocaust and non-fictional texts are the
         main topics. Why is that so? Popular trauma culture is part of a special Holocaust-discourse,
         as Anne Rothe puts it: The Holocaust was »transformed from an event in European history
         into a core constituent of 
         <!--
                       p. -->American memory«, because »it was appropriated on a national level« (Rothe 2011, 7).
         That is why the Holocaust is such a big theme. That is why 9/11 is so interesting,
         and why personal witnesses are so important: Rothe claims, that the »genealogy of
         popular trauma culture includes an analysis of the transition in rhetoric from testimony
         to so-called victim talk and the survivor figures rise to hero status« (ibid., 5).
         This recycles the »Christian suffering-and-redemption trope of spiritual purification
         through physical mortification in trauma-and-recovery-narratives and encodes a latently
         voyeuristic kitsch sentiment as the dominant mode of reception« (ibid., 4, 2). Aren’t
         we all a little traumatized? The single case is not to be taken seriously, everything
         is just the same.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Trauma, on the other hand, has a solid scientific background and can be applied regardless
         of the age of a text. Unlike Freud’s theory, it is not culturally dependent. The notion
         of <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">PTSD </span>and <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">DESNOS </span>might be new, but the ways how people and characters tried to come to terms with traumatic
         experiences were always the same: it was fight, flight, or freeze. Today, we only
         have different and better tools to be able to better understand the structures at
         work, for example the neurobiological background, behavioural patterns, or the concept
         of a trauma scheme.<span id="Note34_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="According to Fischer/Riedesser, a trauma scheme is a »zentrales, in der traumatischen Situation aktiviertes Wahrnehmungs-/Handlungsschema, das im Sinn…" href="#Note34">[34]</a></span> The question is not whether fictional characters are exactly the same as real characters,
         but rather if they react in a way we can understand because that is the way people
         (can) react.<span id="Note35_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="See Jannidis 2006 and Currie 2010 for a different point of view." href="#Note35">[35]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Why is this so important? The rejection of fiction and fictional characters is just
         the other side of the coin of the reluctance of postmodern theorists to concentrate
         on the single case and on narration. Fictional texts can help traumatised people:
         Homer, who is a truly venerable author, is proof that everybody is capable of writing
         about traumatic events without knowing the theory. Jonathan Shay, a psychiatrist working
         with Vietnam veterans in Boston, is the author of two books about the heroes of the
         Homeric epics, <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Achilles in Vietnam </span>and <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Odysseus in America</span>. Naturally, Achilles never was in Vietnam, just as Odysseus never was in America.
         Shay has managed to carve anthropological constants out of these old texts, namely
         the characteristic behaviours of heavily traumatised soldiers. His patients were fascinated:
         It helped them a lot to know that Odysseus, a fictional character from ancient times,
         had had the same problems. Re-reading Homer, Shay has found a fresh interpretation
         of these old texts, too: He sees the homeward journey of Odysseus which lasted ten
         years as an allegory of the inability of a veteran who has already come home to live
         a civilian life. The episode in the <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Lotus Land </span>can be interpreted as an allegory of drug-taking, Odysseus clinging to a branch over
         the whirlpool between Scylla and Charybdis is an allegory for the inability to do
         anything at all in civilian life, or the episodes with Calypso and Circe can stand
         for the flight into sexuality. Shay tries to decode Odysseus’s »adventures in wonderland
         – the most famous part of the epic – as an allegory of real problems of combat veterans
         returning to civilian society« (Shay 2002, 2). In this respect, the reproach »ontological
         incompleteness« of a character, the fictional structure of a story or other theoretical
         problems does not hit the target. Unsurprisingly, none of the papers in <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">JLT </span>or (as far as I know) of the postmodern school cited Shay. His work stands opposite
         to the popular trauma culture.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">2.2. Life Stories</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Why do we read stories about traumatised characters at all? If we define a traumatic
         experience as an experience that overburdens or makes a person unable to integrate
         it into his or her view of the world and the self and which is difficult to tell,
         then the life of a traumatised person seems to be the biggest challenge for the formulation
         of a life story ever, it is the most fascinating »cognitive experiment«, as Lisa Zunshine
         calls the novel in general (Zunshine 2006, 22). The traumatising experience cannot
         be integrated, but it must be.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->Obviously, we cannot stand a fragmented and orderless life story, because we always
         want life stories to make sense (and in my opinion this is the main reason why postmodern
         theorists characterize narrating a trauma as a sacrilege). The stories should explain
         why it is worth living. Dan P. McAdams defines what a good life story should look
         like. He sums up six categories which make a story credible: »coherence«, »openness«
         (you can go on), »credibility« (there are no »gross distortions«), »differentiation«,
         »reconciliation between and among conflicting forces in the story« because »[h]armony
         and resolution must prevail«, and »generative integration«, which means that in »mature
         identity, the adult is able to function as a productive and contributing member of
         society« (McAdams 1993, 111–112). All these categories stand opposite to a-causal
         and a-temporal stored traumatic experiences as experiences of senselessness. For McAdams,
         the main reason to write an autobiography is »the desire to accomplish some meaningful
         personal integration« (ibid., 32). Hence the reason why we are so interested in stories
         about traumatic events might be that we want to read or watch them because we want
         to see how the worst case is incorporated in one life story. The worst must make sense,
         somehow. That is why we like happy endings, too. Traumakitsch perverts this very need.

         of a text by a special and new trauma-text-theory would make the same mistake as the
         postmodern view of trauma, e. g. it would install a new master narration or master

         is possible that the trauma theory approach reveals an underlying trauma scheme, or
         it can also show how a character has been formed so that his special traumatic experience
         is made bearable. The notion of trauma scheme is fascinating (see footnote 34 in this
         paper): Trauma schemes often determine a character. Maybe there is a connection between
         the life of an author who has had traumatic experiences and his or her work?

         luckily had a residence permit for Brazil. He had sent four copies of <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Schachnovelle</span> to several publishers and friends before he and his wife committed suicide. After
         his death, the novel was first published in Brazilian and then in 1943 in German in
         the famous publishing house of Bermann-Fischer in Stockholm.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Dr. B., the protagonist of the novel, was caught by the Nazis. They locked him away
         in a hotel because they wanted to extort some information from him. After some time,
         Dr. B. had the opportunity to steal a book about famous chess-games from one of his
         wards. In his cell, he played chess against himself, getting a »Schachvergiftung«
         (a contamination with chess). This happened a long time ago: Now Dr. B. is on a ship,
         where he tells his story to the narrator. The world champion of chess, Czentovic,
         is also on board of the ship. Dr. B. helps a group of passengers to gain a draw against
         the master. He is enthusiastically asked to line up against 
         <!--
                       p. -->Czentovic for a second time, now on his own. He wins and immediately starts a third
         game although he promised to stop playing after the second round. While he is playing,
         Dr. B. has a flashback, a typical sign for a traumatisation. He starts walking up
         and down the room: »Und schaudernd erkannte ich, es reproduzierte unbewusst dieses
         Auf und Ab das Ausmaß seiner einstmaligen Zelle; genau so musste er in den Monaten
         des Eingesperrtseins auf und ab gerannt sein« (the narrator in Zweig 2013, 71).<span id="Note38_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="»With a shudder, I realized that this pacing back and forth unconsciously reproduced the dimensions of his former cell; in the months of captivity he…" href="#Note38">[38]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">There are fascinating parallels between Dr. B.’s fate and the fate of Zweig.<span id="Note39_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="For further details see Fricke 2006, passim." href="#Note39">[39]</a></span> Putting aside the biographical background (why did Zweig’s wife commit suicide, too?)
         and the obvious flaws of the story (for example the wrong details about chess), one
         strange thing about the novel has been overseen so far: At first sight, the scenario
         in the hotel resembles a kind of torture which was (partly) invented about 20 years
         later and became part of a wider concept of the US secret services. The American psychiatrist
         Albert Bidermann developed his so-called »3-D-System« after he examined several US-soldiers
         who had been tortured in the Korean War: Every torture depends on the three big »Ds«,
         dependence, debility, and dread. Methods to break the victim are isolated imprisonment,
         the monopolisation of experience (the victim can only experience what he is allowed
         to), total devastation, humiliation, beating, little favours, and useless actions
         like standing on your feet for a long time or shovelling sand from one side to the
         other. In the 1960s, Bidermans concept was refined: The CIA financed research in Montreal
         on sensory deprivation as a new technique of torturing. The psychologist Donald O.
         Hebb found out that the identity of the proband began to dissolve after two or three
         days of wearing headphones and clothes filled with rubber foam (compare this with
         the pictures of the inmates in Guantanamo).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">What does that mean? Is Zweig a specialist for techniques of torture? Since this is
         unlikely, one might suspect a trauma scheme at work: Maybe, Dr. B. is the projection
         of Zweig’s desperation as a traumatised refugee? In Zweig’s autobiography <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Die Welt von Gestern</span> (»The World of Yesterday«) there are passages which resemble the ›torture‹ in <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Schachnovelle</span>:<span id="Note40_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="»If I reckon upon the many forms I have filled out during these years, declarations on every trip, [...] the many hours I have spent [the translation…" href="#Note40">[40]</a></span></p>

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext" lang="de" translate="no">After having left London, Zweig waited in Bath »wehrlos wie eine Fliege, machtlos
         wie eine Schnecke […]. Da saß man und harrte und starrte ins Leere wie ein Verurteilter
         in seiner Zelle, eingemauert, eingekettet in dieses sinnlose, kraftlose Warten und

         zwei Stunden, drei Stunden vor der Vernehmung, um den Körper müde, um die Seele mürbe
         zu machen. Und man ließ mich besonders lange warten […], zwei geschlagene Stunden

         Waiting and feeling helpless formed a trauma scheme, fight as well as flight was impossible:
         He could only freeze. This might be a case of sequential traumatisation, as defined
         by Hans Keilson. Fischer and Riedesser give an overview:
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext" lang="de" translate="no">Die sequenzielle Traumatisierung bezeichnet über eine zeitlich verteilte Polytraumatisierung
         hinaus eine in sich kohärente Verlaufsgestalt der traumatischen Erfahrung. Dies wird
         verständlich, wenn man bedenkt, dass jede neue Verfolgungswelle wieder die alten Wunden
         aufreißt und eine zeitlich zwar verteilte, subjektiv jedoch kohärente Verfolgungssituation
         erlebt wird.

         <!--
                       p. -->It is the experience of being pursued which is interpreted as a situation that inevitably
         re-occurs again and again and again. And that’s how it goes.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Taking this into account, why was Zweig’s novel that successful (in sales and as a
         literary work)? He himself had thought that it »was not suitable so much for the large
         public as for a smaller circle«, as he mentioned in a letter to Ben Huebsch (quoted
         by Berlin 1999, 255). At the end of the story, Dr. B. has a flashback, and the narrator
         calms him down:
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext" lang="de" translate="no">Ich sagte nichts als: »Remember!« und fuhr ihm gleichzeitig mit dem Finger über die
         Narbe an seiner Hand. […] »Um Gotteswillen«, flüsterte er mit blassen Lippen. »Habe
         ich etwas Unsinniges gesagt oder getan … bin ich am Ende wieder …?«
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext" lang="de" translate="no">»Nein«, flüsterte ich leise. »Aber Sie müssen sofort die Partie abbrechen. Es ist
         höchste Zeit. Erinnern Sie sich, was der Arzt gesagt hat!<span id="Note44_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="The doctor forbid him to ever play chess again." href="#Note44">[44]</a></span> […] Nur ich wußte, warum dieser Mann nie mehr ein Schachbrett berühren würde, indes
         die andern ein wenig verwirrt zurückblieben mit dem ungewissen Gefühl, mit knapper
         Not etwas Unbehaglichem und Gefährlichem entgangen zu sein […].
      </p>

[...] ›For God’s sake‹, he whispered, his lips pale. ›Have …" href="#Note45">[45]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The message is clear: Keep your mouth shut, and don’t you ever talk about the past
         and your traumatising experiences because this single fate is too »uncomfortable and
         dangerous« for the public. In 1967, the German psychoanalysts Margarete and Alexander
         Mitscherlich published their ground-breaking study of the German inability to grieve.
         In the case of <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Schachnovelle</span>, not to be able to grieve does not hit the target: It is not the inability to grieve,
         but the fear of remembering. That is the reason why such a text written by a Jew was
         warmly welcomed in Germany in the 1950s, because it forbids remembering.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">My interpretation of <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Schachnovelle </span>offers a benefit. In answering several questions it makes use of trauma theory to
         understand the behaviour of one person (Zweig) and of one of his characters (Dr. B.)
         in using the notion of flashback and sequential traumatisation, and it offers an explanation
         for a paradox: Why does Zweig describe a technique of torture which was invented 20
         years later? My proposal is: He translated a trauma scheme, e. g. his traumatic experiences
         as a helpless refugee on the fate of Dr. B. Additionally, I offer an answer to the
         question why <span class="JLT_Hervorhebung">Schachnovelle</span> was so successful although Zweig rated it a minor work, because it forbids remembering
         and could easily become a fragment of Holocaust-Kitsch.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Is there any other use in this interpretation? I hope that it makes more sensitive
         for the problems of refugees and for the use of the Holocaust as a means to an end:
         In 2011 Günter Franzen in a radio programme proposed a different way of remembering
         the 9<sup>th</sup> of November 1938 (the date of the »Kristallnacht«) and mentioned a new edition of
         the letters between Stefan Zweig and Joseph Roth:<span id="Note46_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="»One needs not to be an ahistorical follower of the dogma of drawing the line under history, to be embarrassed by the staged theatre of remembrance b…" href="#Note46">[46]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Zitat_in_Haupttext" lang="de" translate="no">Man muss kein geschichtsvergessener Anhänger der Schlussstrich-Theorie sein, um angesichts
         des alljährlich von der politischen Klasse unseres Landes inszenierten Gedächtnistheaters
         nur noch peinlich berührt zu sein. [...] [Die Briefe von Roth an Zweig sind eine]
         Geschichte des Untergangs einer Welt. [...] Joseph Roth starb am 27. Mai 1939 in einem
         Pariser Armenhospital an Lungenentzündung. Stefan Zweig und seine Frau Charlotte Altmann
         nahmen sich am 22. Februar 1942 im brasilianischen Petrópolis mit einer Überdosis
         Veronal das Leben. Zwei von sechs Millionen, deren Schicksal uns an diesem 9. November
         des Jahres 2011 nicht kalt lassen kann. [...] Die Zukunft einer generationsübergreifenden
         Erinnerungskultur liegt in der stillen und unaufdringlichen Verlebendigung von Einzelschicksalen.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Two of six million? Neither the Zweigs nor Roth died in a concentration camp. On the
         contrary, the letters show the very peculiar relationship between the two authors.
         Both had their problems: Zweig was afraid to have lost his audience, was terrified
         by his displacement; Roth had to fight alcoholism and needed money. Zweig had difficulties
         with Roth’s behaviour; Roth despised Zweig because of his financial success as a writer.
         Their letters 
         <!--
                       p. -->show their personal problems and shine a light on their peculiar relationship. So,
         why should this relationship with its special entanglements serve as an example for
         six million murdered Jews? To generalize these two fates is exactly what Franzen blames
         the political speech makers for. And there is an assertion in Franzen’s speech which
         aims in the same direction: He stated that Stefan and Charlotte Zweig committed suicide
         using Veronal. This is wrong, because only Stefan took Veronal, but Lotte took formic
         acid (the poison of the poor) later and died after a severe death struggle. Again,
         Franzen created Holocaust-Kitsch.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">When writing my first article on Zweig’s »Chess« I became more and more upset. Zweig
         had asked his first wife Friderike if she was willing to commit suicide together with
         him, just as his role model Heinrich von Kleist and Henriette Vogel had done. Friderike
         refused, and later on Stefan married again: Lotte. I discussed my paper several times
         with my father, the trauma therapist Peter Fricke, on the telephone: How could Zweig
         do that? And why does nobody want to know the details?<span id="Note47_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Cf. my »Verstreute Perlen in viel Aspik«, a review of Oliver Matuscheks Drei Leben. Stefan Zweig – Eine Biographie. Frankfurt/M.: S. Fischer 2006. Ma…" href="#Note47">[47]</a></span> My father calmed me down by saying over thirty times »But what a poor guy!«. Only
         after these slow-downs I became able to face my counter-transference. Only after that
         I was able to try to understand Zweig’s single fate as a chain of traumata, as a sequential
         traumatisation. Something unexplainable became explainable – in a dialectical way,
         as Fischer might put it.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">4. Résumé and Guidelines</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Considering that applying a (new) theory should result in a valid and new interpretation
         of a text (which itself should be open for questions) and not in inaugurating a new
         master narration, I think that we can benefit from the use of trauma theory in a special
         way: It endows us with a solid scientific background which enables us to approach
         a single (sometimes often well-known) text in an empathetic, flexible and at the same
         time reserved way, ideally without any moral presuppositions. This way of approaching
         may be able to explain why we respond to certain texts and especially to certain characters
         the way we do regardless of the age of the texts. This way of dealing with fates and
         persons and characters is not cold, but empathetic, and it is politically relevant.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Five guidelines might help you when applying trauma theory (which is nevertheless
         a difficult, challenging and dangerous task):
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">1. Be careful to generalize and to reificate (»the« trauma, all the victims, the perpetrator,
         the survivor). Concentrate on the single case.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">2. Be careful whom to cite (Freud, Lacan, Caruth, and others).</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">3. Be careful in using any normative prescriptions (»The victim is not allowed to
         do this and that«).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">4. Always think of the aim and the benefit of your own interpretation: What do you
         want? Do you really need trauma theory?
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">5. Be careful with yourself and be aware of your counter-transferences: Trauma means
         extreme suffering. Trauma theory is no fun-sport, and if taken seriously, it will
         change you, as Friedrich Nietzsche knew: »He who fights with monsters should look
         to it that he himself does not become a monster. And when you gaze long into an abyss
         the abyss also gazes into you.«<span id="Note48_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Nietzsche 1973, 84 (Aphorism 146 from Beyond Good and Evil [1886])." href="#Note48">[48]</a></span></p>

               states that in his early papers on hysteria Freud »stressed the role of a post-traumatic
               ›incubation‹ or latency period of psychic elaboration, in ways that made the traumatic
               experience irreducible to the idea of a purely psychological causal sequence« (ibid.,
               19). It was »not the experience itself which acted traumatically but its delayed revival
               as <span class="pdf_RezJLT_Endnotentext_Hervorhebung_Zchn">memory</span> after the individual had entered sexual maturity«; for Freud »trauma was thus constituted
               by a dialectic between two [!] events, neither of which was intrinsically traumatic«
               in connection with his concept of ›Nachträglichkeit‹ (deferred action)« (ibid., 20).
               After the First World War Freud changed the paradigm (as he did several times): Trauma
               was »thus defined in quasi-military terms as a widespread rupture or breach in the
               ego’s protective shield, one that set in motion every possible attempt at defence
               even as the pleasure principle itself was put out of action« (ibid.). Obviously, the
               paradigm changed, and it could not easily be transferred on modern research, because
               if taken seriously, you have to cope with two non-traumatic events and their dialectical
               relationship, or the pleasure principle, or other details of Freud’s theory. <a class="Hyperlink back" href="#Note8_return">

               Prager 1998, 156, did: »The wartime events evoke the prerepresentational experience
               of maternal trauma [...]; war becomes modelled on the child’s earliest reactions to
               the loss of it’s mother«. Taken strictly, this means that only those who have experienced
               the loss of their mother as traumatic could react on experiences in wartime in a traumatic
               way. <a class="Hyperlink back" href="#Note16_return">

               Situation aktiviertes Wahrnehmungs-/Handlungsschema, das im Sinne von Trauma als einem
               unterbrochenen Handlungsansatz mit Kampf- und Fluchttendenz die traumatische Erfahrung
               im Gedächtnis speichert«. It has »die Tendenz zur Wiederholung, […], in diesem Falle
               verstärkt durch die Tendenz zur Wiederaufnahme unterbrochener Handlungen« (2009, 395–96;
               »a central scheme of perception/ action in the traumatic scene, which (in the sense
               of a discontinued action with a fight-flighttendency) stores the traumatic experience
               in memory« and which has »a tendency to be repeated, in this case strengthened by
               the tendency to recapture actions that have been disconnected«). The notion of trauma
               scheme is a powerful tool in literary research (see page 189 in this paper). <a class="Hyperlink back" href="#Note34_return">

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Titel_Rezension">How Can We Be Moved to Shoot Zombies? A Paradox of Fictional Emotions <span class="Emphasis">and Actions</span> in Interactive Fiction
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">Full-length article in: JLT 12/2 (2018), 279–299.</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">How can we be moved by the fate of Anna Karenina? By asking this question, Colin Radford
         introduced the paradox of fiction, or the problem that we are often emotionally moved
         by characters and events which we know don’t really exist (1975). A puzzling element
         of these emotions that always resurfaced within discussions on the paradox is the
         fact that, although these emotions <span style="font-style:italic">feel </span>real to the people who have them, their difference from ›real‹ emotions is that they
         cannot motivate us to perform any actions. The idea that actions towards fictional
         particulars are impossible still underlies recent work within the philosophy of fiction
         (cf. Matravers 2014, 26 sqq.; Friend 2017, 220; Stock 2017, 168). In the past decennia,
         however, the medium of interactive fiction has challenged this crystallized idea.
         Videogames, especially augmented and virtual reality games, offer us agency in their
         fictional worlds: players of computer games can interact with fictional objects, save
         characters that are invented, and kill monsters that are clearly non-existent within
         worlds that are mere representations on a screen. In a parallel to Radford’s original
         question, we might ask: how can we be moved to shoot zombies, when we know they aren’t
         real? The purpose of this article is to examine the new paradox of <span style="font-style:italic">interactive fiction</span>, which questions how we can be moved to <span style="font-style:italic">act</span> on objects we know to be fictional, its possible solutions, and its connection to
         the traditional paradox of fictional emotions.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Videogames differ from traditional fictional media in that they let their appreciators
         enter their fictional worlds in the guise of a fictional proxy, and grant their players
         agency within this world. As interactive fictions, videogames reveal new elements
         of the relationship between fiction, emotions, and actions that have been previously
         neglected because of the focus on non-interactive fiction such as literature, theatre,
         and film. They show us that fictional objects can not only cause actions, but can
         also be the intentional object of these actions. Moreover, they show us that emotions
         towards fictions can motivate us to act, and that conversely, the possibility of undertaking
         actions within the fictional world makes a wider array of emotions towards fictional
         objects possible. Since the player is involved in the fictional world and responsible
         for his actions therein, self-reflexive emotions such as guilt and shame are common
         reactions to the interactive fiction experience. As such, videogames point out a very
         close connection between emotions and actions towards fictions and introduce the paradox
         of <span style="font-style:italic">interactive fiction:</span> a paradox of fictional <span style="font-style:italic">actions</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This paradox of fictional actions that is connected to our experiences of interactive
         fiction consists of three premises that cannot be true at the same time, as this would
         result in a contradiction:
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">1. Players act on videogame objects.</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">2. Videogame objects are fictional.</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">3. It is impossible to act on fictional objects.</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->The first premise seems to be obviously true: gamers manipulate game objects when
         playing. The second one is true for at least some videogame objects we act upon, such
         as zombies. The third premise is a consequence of the ontological gap between the
         real world and fictional worlds. So which one needs to be rejected?
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Although the paradox of interactive fiction is never discussed as such within videogame
         philosophy, there seem to be two strategies at hand to solve this paradox, both of
         which are examined in this article. The first strategy is to deny that the game objects
         we can act on are fictional at all. Espen Aarseth, for example, argues that they are
         <span style="font-style:italic">virtual </span>objects (cf. 2007), while other philosophers argue that players interact with real,
         computer-generated graphical representations (cf. Juul 2005; Sageng 2012). However,
         Aarseth’s concept of the virtual seems to be ad hoc and unhelpful, and describing
         videogame objects and characters as real, computer-generated graphical representations
         does not account for the emotional way in which we often relate to them. The second
         solution is based on Kendall Walton’s make-believe theory, and, similar to Walton’s
         solution to the original paradox of fictional emotions, says that the actions we perform
         towards fictional game objects are not real actions, but <span style="font-style:italic">fictional</span> actions. A Waltonian description of fictional actions can explain our paradoxical
         actions on fictional objects in videogames, although it does raise questions about
         the validity of Walton’s concept of quasi-emotions. Indeed, the way players’ emotions
         can motivate them to act in a certain manner seems to be a strong argument against
         the concept of quasi-emotions, which Walton introduced to explain the alleged <span style="font-style:italic">non</span>-motivationality of emotions towards fiction (cf. 1990, 201 sq.).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Although both strategies to solve the paradox of interactive fiction might ultimately
         not be entirely satisfactory, the presentation of these strategies in this paper not
         only introduces a starting point for discussing this paradox, but also usefully supplements
         and clarifies existing discussions on the paradoxical <span style="font-style:italic">emotions</span> we feel towards fictions. I argue that if we wish to solve the paradox of actions
         towards (interactive) fiction, we should treat it in close conjunction with the traditional
         paradox of emotional responses to fiction.

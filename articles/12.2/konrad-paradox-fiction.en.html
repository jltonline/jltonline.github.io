         and Current Areas of Research, including a Comprehensive Bibliography from 1975 to
         2018
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Lit_Angaben_Rezensiertes_Buch">Full-length article in: JLT 12/2 (2018), 193–203.</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Exactly forty years ago, readers of the <span class="Emphasis">Journal of Philosophy</span> first heard about a certain guy called Charles who was sitting in his chair watching
         a movie. At some point during the film, a green slime started approaching the camera.
         Charles’ pulse quickened, his palms started to sweat, and he clutched the arms of
         his chair. After the movie, he reported that he was really afraid of the slime. Apart
         from the observation that both monsters and moviegoers have come a long way since
         the seventies, nothing about this case seems to be particularly interesting. Charles,
         however, has become famous – at least among philosophers, aestheticians and literary
         critics. The reason is, of course, Kendall L. <span class="Hyperlink">Walton</span>’s seminal paper »Fearing Fictions« in which he both doubts that Charles’ judgement
         about his affective state is correct and raises the general question of whether affective
         responses which are directed towards fictional entities (we will call them »fictional
         emotions« from now on) are structurally identical to emotions directed towards real
         entities (cf. Walton 1978). Together with Colin <span class="Hyperlink">Radford</span>’s article »How Can We Be Moved by the Fate of Anna Karenina?« Walton’s paper led
         to a debate about fictional emotions that still goes on today, and in particular about
         a problem which is often referred to by the term »paradox of fiction«. The paradox
         is constituted by three apparently plausible premises that cannot be <span class="Emphasis">conjointly</span> true at the same time:
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">(1) We have (genuine/rational) emotions towards fictional entities.</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">(2) To have an (genuine/rational) emotion towards an entity, we must believe that
         this entity exists.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">(3) We do not believe that fictional entities exist.</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">This special issue presents a collection of essays which deal with this paradox, or,
         more generally, with problems surrounding fictional emotions. In our brief introduction,
         we want to pose some questions that we think are still up for debate, survey recent
         developments in the discussion, and outline areas of research that are currently developing.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The focus of the debate has witnessed a clear and considerable shift since Radford’s
         and Walton’s first contributions. The central reason is simple: Walton and Radford
         are cognitivists in the sense that, for them, emotions involve judgements or beliefs.
         My anger at somebody, they would argue, involves the judgement or belief that I have
         been wronged by that person. For cognitivists like Walton and Radford, premise (2)
         is <span class="Emphasis">prima facie</span> just as plausible and difficult to reject as premises (1) and (3). They are dealing
         with a real <span class="Emphasis">paradox</span>, and finally dissolve it by rejecting premise (1).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Today, however, there are only a few proponents of cognitivism left. Most philosophers,
         literary critics and psychologists advocate, for example, appraisal theories (cf.
         <span class="Hyperlink">Frijda</span> 1986; Scherer/Schorr/Johnstone 2001; <span class="Hyperlink">Robinson</span> 2005), perceptual theories (cf. <span class="Hyperlink">Döring</span> 2003; <span class="Hyperlink">Prinz</span> 2004; <span class="Hyperlink">Kauppinen</span> 2013; <span class="Hyperlink">Tappolet</span> 2016), feeling theories (cf. <span class="Hyperlink">Goldie</span> 2009) or construal theories 
         <!--
                       p. -->(cf. de Sousa 1987; <span class="Hyperlink">Roberts</span> 2003). According to these theories, emotions do not involve judgements or beliefs.
         For them, premise (2) is simply false. The consequence is as obvious as radical: there
         is no paradox of fiction, and there has never been.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Does that mean that the debate is over? Should we cease talking about a paradox that
         doesn’t even exist? We do not think so, and neither do the contributors to our volume.
         Why not? Even if one supposes that there is no paradox (anymore), one can still learn
         much about the various other topics that surround the discussion of the paradox. This
         point has been made by Robert <span class="Hyperlink">Stecker</span> (2011, 308), among many others: »The paradox of fiction has been a valuable tool
         for exploring the nature of both imaginative and emotional responses to fiction.«
         In accordance with Stecker, we think that there were, and there still are, a number
         of questions raised in the context of the paradox of fiction (some of them already
         posed by Walton and Radford) which are of equally vital interest for cognitivists
         and non-cognitivists.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">One of these crucial and complex questions, initially raised by Walton, concerns <span class="Emphasis">the nature of fictional emotions</span>. Whether fictional emotions are genuine emotions or not depends on the definition
         of the term »genuine emotion«. Emotions are typically considered to be mental phenomena
         associated with a cognitive base, action tendencies, bodily changes, affectivity,
         and evaluation: A person who is afraid of a lion in front of them will typically have
         certain beliefs about the lion (e. g. that the lion is in front of them), they will
         have a tendency to act or behave in a certain way (e. g. to flee from the lion), they
         might have an increased heart rate and tensed muscles, they will have a certain feeling
         of unpleasantness and evaluate the lion as dangerous. Whether these features are components
         or mere companions of emotions is a hotly debated question, and the corresponding
         answer will have an impact on the evaluation of fictional emotions.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Additionally, there are differences between the fear of a real entity like a lion
         and the fear of a fictional entity like a dragon with respect to the aforementioned
         features which need to be considered: fictional emotions are not accompanied with
         or do not entail beliefs or judgments about the real world (we do not believe that
         the dragon is in front of us) and therefore differ from emotions directed at real
         entities with respect to the cognitive base. Moreover, we do not evaluate the dragon
         as dangerous to us. Also, fictional emotions do not lead to specific actions, namely
         actions directed at the object of the emotion like fleeing from the dragon or kissing
         the heroine. Further features of difference concerning the affectivity are the intensity
         and duration of fictional emotions, and that they are out of character with respect
         to the bearer’s usual or everyday emotional responses. Only bodily changes do not
         seem to differ in the fictional and the non-fictional case: We can observe tensed
         muscles and increased heart rate in both those who are afraid of a real lion and those
         who are afraid of a fictional dragon. Since the assumed differences on the one hand
         and a general theory of emotions on the other hand are still up for debate, there
         remains a lot to be said about the question of whether fictional emotions are genuine
         emotions.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Another important question, originally raised by Radford, concerns <span class="Emphasis">the rationality of fictional emotions</span>. Fictional emotions seem to have a lot in common with emotional responses we typically
         evaluate to be irrational. In both cases, there is a certain tension between the emotional
         response and the evaluation of the object of the emotion. Just as a lot of people
         are afraid of spiders despite their belief that spiders aren’t dangerous (at least
         if they live in northern Europe), readers and viewers don’t believe that fictional
         monsters are dangerous, and yet they respond affectively. Nevertheless, the two cases
         are not completely similar: Since fictional monsters are dangerous in the world of
         fiction, fearing them seems to be at least a more rational response than, for example,
         being jealous of them. It remains an open question, however, how (or even if) a true
         belief or judgement about the world of fiction could justify a fictional emotion.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->A related topic in need of further elaboration concerns the question of <span class="Emphasis">why we are moved by fiction</span>. What is especially puzzling is the odd difference between our emotional reactions
         to real-life and to fictional situations, also mentioned by Radford: When someone
         tells us a moving story about a dog she once had who was run over, we certainly pity
         the dog and the narrator as well. But if we discover that the whole story was made
         up, our emotional reaction of pity would immediately stop. Readers and viewers of
         fiction, in contrast, know right from the beginning that the fictional characters
         do not exist and that the whole story is made up – and yet this does not prevent them
         from reacting affectively. Both those who claim that fictional emotions are quasi-emotions
         and those who claim that fictional emotions are genuine emotions have to explain these
         different effects of the negative existential belief in the fictional and the non-fictional
         scenario: Why does the emotional reaction in the non-fictional scenario stop although
         it persists in the fictional scenario? Or against the background of the assumption
         of quasi-emotions: Why do genuine emotions not turn into quasi-emotions and persist
         as such in the non-fictional scenario? Why does a negative existential belief in the
         fictional scenario not prevent <span class="Emphasis">any</span> emotional reaction, whether these reactions are categorised as genuine or non-genuine
         emotions? To explain why readers and viewers are moved by fiction, a theory about
         the psychological processes that take place when we read fictional stories or watch
         fictional films is necessary. Furthermore, it is questionable whether the above-mentioned
         example works with any kind of emotional reaction. It seems true that the sadness
         caused by a story about a dog which was run over by a car does not persist once we
         are informed that the story was just made up. But what about a case in which we are
         amused by a funny story about a dog stealing a sandwich? One could argue that the
         affective state of being amused would probably not stop (at least not as abruptly)
         if we found out that the story was just a made-up joke. This example leads to the
         question of whether emotions of different kinds, like fear and amusement, need to
         be approached differently, in particular with respect to fictionality.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Several papers in this volume take up these open questions or use the ongoing debate
         about the paradox of fiction as a point of departure for their discussion of related
         topics in the area of fictional emotions. Essays collected here concern themselves
         with our appreciation of fiction (Ìngrid <span class="Hyperlink">Vendrell Ferran</span>), the difference between our real-life and fiction-based empathic reactions (Anja
         Berninger), desires about fictional states of affairs (Eva Maria Düringer) and the
         relation of emotions towards fictional entities and towards situations of the reader’s
         life (Christoph Demmerling).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Another reason for our continued interest in the paradox of fiction is the observation
         that there are some <span class="Emphasis">specific areas of research which are currently developing</span>, or have been neglected until recently. Researchers working in these fields have
         been encountering entirely new problems that might shed new light on some »old questions«
         and that have yet to be addressed. Think, for example, about videogames: To what extent
         do they challenge the apparent truism that readers or viewers cannot interact with
         fictional characters? Are emotional reactions to characters in videogames different
         from emotional reactions to characters in traditional fiction? In the context of our
         volume, Nele van de Mosselaer takes up these and related questions and ponders the
         ramifications of a potential <span class="Emphasis">paradox of interactive fiction</span>. Benjamin Gittel focusses his attention on the special case of a <span class="Emphasis">paradox of fiction for moods</span>, while Frank <span class="Hyperlink">Zipfel</span> considers the broader <span class="Emphasis">paradox of mimesis</span> that deals not only with emotional reactions to fiction but with emotional reactions
         to representations of objects of emotions in general.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">We conclude our brief introduction with a comprehensive bibliography of research literature
         on the paradox of fiction. The term »comprehensive« has to be taken with a grain of
         salt. We concentrate on the »modern debate« that started with Radford and do not consider
         any literature that was published before 1975. Of course, there are important predecessors,
         and the historical dimension of the debate has been much neglected until now. Furthermore,
         we listed only works 
         <!--
                       p. -->(in English or German) which placed their main focus on the paradox of fiction. There
         are many books on related topics that include a small section about the paradox. Since
         we wanted our bibliography to have a strong focus on the core issues of the paradox
         of fiction, our decision was not to list them. Josefine Plachetka and Sara Köthemann
         were of great assistance to us in collecting the bibliographical data listed below.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Titel_Rezension">Against Empathy: Levinas and Ethical Criticism in the 21st Century</p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">1 Introduction</p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">»So – ethical criticism is back«, declares Marshall W. Gregory in his contribution
         to the debate initiated by the <span class="Emphasis">Journal of Literary Theory</span> concerning the long-term relations between literature and ethics (Gregory 2010, 282).
         Gregory argues that ethical criticism has received a »second chance« after being »killed,
         crushed, annihilated« throughout the 20th century (ibid., 274). To avoid squandering
         this opportunity, he suggests, it is crucial to identify »what’s at stake in ethical
         criticism« (ibid., 282). In this article, we join Gregory and subsequent contributors
         in the effort to rethink the role of ethical criticism in the context of contemporary
         literary scholarship (Rabinowitz 2010; Groeben 2011; Titzmann 2012). We wish to turn
         attention to an issue that has thus far been largely ignored in this debate: the role
         of postmodern criticism in shaping the new face of ethical criticism. In particular,
         we challenge the concept of empathy and the assumption that empathy is a fundamental
         element of ethical reading.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">The first three studies in the JLT controversy (Gregory 2010; Rabinowitz 2010; Groeben
         2011) share a prominent assumption: that postmodern thinking has turned its back on
         ethics. <span id="Note1_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="At the beginning of his essay, Norbert Groeben formulates the critique of postmodernism made by both Gregory and Rabinowitz: »The point where Gregory…" href="#Note1">[1]</a></span> Gregory presents a historical account that aims to explain the various circumstances
         that »swept ethical criticism away« (Gregory 2010, 273) and the gradual changes that
         later led to its partial revival. He suggests that 20th-century »theory« is responsible
         for the fall of ethical criticism: enumerating various theoretical movements such
         as Marxism, Freudianism, post-colonial studies and deconstruction, he specifically
         notes »New Criticism« and »postmodernism« as critical approaches that »did more than
         merely discredit ethical criticism of the arts; they tended to discredit ethics as
         a general human enterprise« (ibid., 274).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">Indeed, the 20th-century legacy of critical thinking, highly influenced by the historical
         developments of this era – two world wars, a surge in capitalism, a technological
         revolution, the dynamic forces of globalization and mass immigration – brought a great
         measure of instability and uncertainty to the discourse of ethics. This uncertainty
         has been discussed extensively by postmodern thinkers who, since the last decades
         of the previous century, have pointed out different aspects of »crisis« in Western
         philosophy, art and politics and the consequent dissolution of traditional forms of
         ethical thinking.<span id="Note2_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="See Lyotard’s famous discussion of the cultural crisis that characterizes post-industrial Western societies, in his The Postmodern Condition (1984). …" href="#Note2">[2]</a></span> Our article sets out to explore the implications of this uncertainty for ethical
         literary criticism: Does the insecure grounding of ethics make ethical criticism impossible?
         Can ethical criticism exist in a postmodern era, sharing in postmodern discourse?
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">Contrary to Gregory’s claim, we argue that postmodern thinking has actually played
         – and continues to play – an important role in the renewed interest in the field of
         ethics and in ethical criticism,<span id="Note3_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="It is remarkable that several of the writers most identified with postmodern thinking have turned attention to the exploration of ethics. See, for ex…" href="#Note3">[3]</a></span> although this approach has unsettled the established doctrines of modern ethical
         thinking.<span id="Note4_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="In Postmodern Ethics Zigmunt Bauman clarifies: »the novelty of the postmodern approach to ethics consists first and foremost not in the abandoning of…" href="#Note4">[4]</a></span> Specifically, postmodern thinking motivates us to challenge the idea of empathy as
         a basis for ethical reading, a notion that has overshadowed both the theory and the
         practice of modern ethical criticism. We argue that, to be a relevant approach in
         the study of literature today, ethical criticism must extend its scope beyond the
         ethics of narrative empathy. Looking at what we believe to be the most influential
         and interesting stream in postmodern ethical thinking – Emmanuel Levinas’s conceptualization
         of the infinite responsibility towards the inaccessible other – we identify the major
         problems of the concept of empathy. We then offer 
         <!--
                       p. -->an alternative way of thinking about ethical criticism as involving an attentive response
         to the representation of suffering while deconstructing the empathetic position of
         the reader. We illustrate our suggestion through a reading of Margaret Atwood’s <span class="Emphasis">Alias Grace</span> (1996).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">2 Defining Empathie</p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">The notion of <span class="Emphasis">empathy</span>, which has long engaged philosophers, psychologists, and literary critics, refers
         to the human ability of thinking and feeling »with« the mental states of another person,
         »looking into« the other’s mind and simulating his or her experience.<span id="Note5_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="For an elaborate study of the concept of empathy, see the collection Empathy – Philosophical and Psychological Perspectives (Coplan/Goldie 2011a); se…" href="#Note5">[5]</a></span> As Rae Greiner explains, empathy often involves an intentional and conscious act
         of imagination or projection, since it is »a way for the ego to gaze upon itself and
         transport itself into the minds and bodies of others« (Greiner 2011, 418). This process
         in which the Self imagines itself in the place of another was highly praised in the
         18th and 19th centuries by philosophers such as David Hume and Adam Smith, who thought
         of this process – which they referred to as »sympathy« or »fellow-feeling« – as the
         basis of pro-social behavior.<span id="Note6_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="On the moral sentiment in 18th-century English philosophy, see Frazer 2010; see also Keen 2007, 42–48." href="#Note6">[6]</a></span> Their analyses, in addition to works that emerged after the term »empathy« was coined
         in the early 20th century, conceptualized this process as fulfilling two roles: facilitating
         an understanding of other minds and promoting ethical action toward a suffering human-fellow.<span id="Note7_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Amy Coplan and Peter Goldie explain this two-fold understanding of empathy in their introduction to Empathy (cf. Coplan/Goldie 2011b, ix–xvii)." href="#Note7">[7]</a></span> Artistic representations, in particular, were considered to be a means of simulating
         another person’s inner state of mind.<span id="Note8_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="On empathy as the effect of artistic representation, see Coplan/Goldie 2011b, viii–xliii; Feagin 2011. On the equivalent Victorian appraisal of sympa…" href="#Note8">[8]</a></span> Empathy, therefore, has often been discussed as an aesthetic experience with ethical
         significance, an experience that takes place when readers engage emotionally with
         literary texts and simulate the internal perspective of fictional characters or narrators
         (cf. Keen 2007, 39–40).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">Twentieth-century ethics of narrative empathy suggests that narratives employ rhetorical
         techniques that, by arousing readers’ imaginations and inviting them to identify closely
         with fictional characters, open »a wide range of ethical responses« in the readers
         (Harrison 2008, 258).<span id="Note9_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Harrison enumerates several possible kinds of such ethical responses: »altruism and prosocial behavior, moral development, interpersonal bonding, and…" href="#Note9">[9]</a></span> Gregory’s model of a new ethical criticism presents an interesting version of such
         an ethics of narrative empathy. It consists of analyzing the various invitations that
         a literary work extends to its readers – »invitations to feelings«, »invitations to
         belief«, and »invitations to ethical judgment« (Gregory 2010, 291) – and constructing
         their possible ethical effects on the reader, who responds with a »yes« or a »no«
         to these invitations. Demonstrating his new model through Robert Herrick’s 17th-century
         poem »Upon Julia’s Clothes«, Gregory points to the »most obvious invitation« in the
         poem: »an invitation for the reader to enter the feelings and thoughts of the speaker«
         (ibid., 293). It is here that Gregory locates the ethical point: »As the reader empathetically
         replicates the speaker’s feelings and point of view, he or she undergoes the ethically
         significant activity of seeing the world in this poem through another person’s eyes,
         mind, heart, and feelings« (ibid., 294–295). Gregory’s assumption that seeing through
         another person’s eyes is »ethically significant« appears in various approaches of
         ethical criticism, of which the most famous is probably that of Martha Nussbaum.<span id="Note10_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="For a concise overview of the ethical significance of the empathetic response according to Nussbaum see »Exactly and Responsibly« (Nussbaum 2001)." href="#Note10">[10]</a></span> This idea is also implied by different scholars in the field of ethical criticism
         who refer to notions such as »moral knowledge« or »thought experiment« without mentioning
         the term »empathy«, but nonetheless contend that imagining a fictional situation from
         an inside-perspective is an ethically productive process.<span id="Note11_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="See, for example, Gregory Currie who writes on ›moral knowledge‹: »We imagine ourselves in a certain situation which the fiction describes, imagining…" href="#Note11">[11]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">Empathetic response involves perspective-shifting. Yet, not all perspective-shifting
         involves empathy. Amy Coplan distinguishes between what she calls »pseudo-empathy«
         (Coplan 2011, 12) – which consists of »self-oriented perspective-taking« that occurs
         »when we try to imagine how <span class="Emphasis">we</span> would feel if in the other’s situation« (ibid., 9, italics in the original) – and
         a true empathetic position of »other-oriented perspective-taking« (ibid., 13). Peter
         Goldie adds that the empathetic position of simulating the point of view, feelings
         and beliefs of another person is indeed imagining »<span class="Emphasis">being</span> the other person« (Goldie 2011, 302; italics in the original). It seems 
         <!--
                       p. -->that the ethics of narrative empathy and Gregory’s model of ethical criticism refer
         – even if implicitly – to the latter<span class="Emphasis">, other-oriented</span> empathetic response when analyzing the potential ethical effect of literature. That
         is, entering the deepest dimensions of the other’s point of view and empathetically
         simulating her experience is considered to have an inherent ethical benefit: it shapes
         the readers’ ethical beliefs and attitudes and thus promotes their ethical development.
         However, the conception of ethical reading that is based on simulating <span class="Emphasis">being</span> another person raises several troubling questions: is it indeed possible to take
         the perspective of another – be it a real person or a literary character – and imaginatively
         simulate her subjective experience? Does the act of perspective-taking, together with
         the emotional response of empathy, produce an ethical effect on the readers? In what
         follows we call into question the idea that other-oriented empathy is possible and
         the assumption that simulating the inner perspective of the other is an ethical process
         of reading.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">3 Challenging Empathie</p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">Over the years critics have praised the power of literature to cultivate the capacity
         for empathy but also raised doubts regarding the potential of empathetic fictional
         reading to engender actual and long-lasting ethical influences.<span id="Note12_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="See Suzanne Keen’s chapter »The Literary Career of Empathy« (Keen 2007, 37–64)." href="#Note12">[12]</a></span> A major point of disagreement in this debate stems from the question of whether literature-produced
         empathy indeed contributes to making individuals good citizens, sensitive and engaged
         with altruistic behavior. In this context, Suzanne Keen asserts that empathy with
         fictional characters has not been proven to activate helping behavior in the real
         social sphere (cf. Keen 2007, vii).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">From a postmodern perspective, there are several other problems with the ethics of
         empathetic reading and its supposed effects on the readers. Theories that advocate
         empathy lean on the hypothesis of universality, apparent in the assumption that readers
         share universal feelings and experiences with various fictional characters or speakers,
         and can thus replicate those characters’ inner perspectives. Specifically, the reader
         is assumed to have a privileged position that transcends limiting historical and social
         conditions and allows her to enter the mind of the fictional character and deeply
         understand that character’s experience.<span id="Note13_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Andrew Gibson writes about the »Olympian height« of this ethical position (Gibson 1999, 11)." href="#Note13">[13]</a></span> Postmodern theories, in contrast, analyze the category of the »universal« as a political
         illusion that serves to efface social injustices and to ignore crucial cultural differences
         (cf. Braidotti 2006, 23).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">The postmodern perspective highlights a problem of presumptiveness in the universalist
         empathetic reading, especially when dealing with representations of historically excluded
         and devalued »others« whose suffering has been constantly silenced or distorted. First,
         we suspect that although »suffering« in general can be viewed as a shared human experience,
         empathetic reading can too easily involve disregard towards cases of distress that
         do not fit the conventional category of suffering. Betty Friedan’s <span class="Emphasis">The Feminine Mystique</span> (1963) reflects this problem as it discusses the »dream image« of »the suburban housewife«
         in 1950s American culture (Friedan 1963, 18). The many consumers of this image – both
         men and women – had read about »the happy housewife heroine« (ibid., 33) in magazines
         and books and had seen her in films and in television commercials which invited an
         empathetic engagement with her point of view and values. Nonetheless, for many years
         they could not detect her misery – that which Friedan’s book terms »the problem that
         has no name« (ibid., 20). As Friedan writes, »there was much sympathy for the educated
         housewife«, but no awareness of her profound despair (ibid., 23). Since her suffering
         could not be described »in terms of the age-old material problems of men: poverty,
         sickness, hunger, cold« (ibid., 26), nor explained by the familiar frameworks of understanding
         women’s needs, even the most empathetic observers missed or misinterpreted her deep
         frustration.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->Second, even when acknowledging the suffering of the other, an empathetic reading
         risks ignoring the concrete circumstances and the radical uniqueness of the sufferer.
         Under the presumption of empathy, people tend to dismiss aspects of difference and
         believe that they can truly know the subjective mindset of another person, sometimes
         even better than that person.<span id="Note14_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="An ironic example of a well-meaning empathetic presumption is that of David Lurie from Coetzee’s Disgrace (1999). As a loving father and as a profess…" href="#Note14">[14]</a></span> Such presumptiveness has been at the core of colonial practices whose aim was to
         reduce the suffering of colonized others – that is, to reduce what Western colonizers
         understood, or misunderstood to be suffering.<span id="Note15_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="See, for example, Wanhalla 2007 on eugenics practices of restricting the reproduction of the ›unfit‹ in New Zealand in 1900–1935." href="#Note15">[15]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">Narrative empathy must involve an interpretation of the experience of the other and
         thus it is liable to overlook the difficulty that a reader is likely to encounter
         in imagining the specific experience of the suffering of another, even if the character
         is accurately represented and the reader is very attentive. The problematic nature
         of this presumptiveness is revealed when we take a familiar literary example such
         as Tolstoy’s <span class="Emphasis">Anna Karenina</span> (1877), and imagine how a woman in contemporary Western society might read it. Can
         we assume that such a reader is able to adopt Anna’s perspective and put herself in
         the place of the agitated heroine when she reveals her pregnancy to Vronsky? It is
         probably possible to achieve what Goldie calls »imagining-how-it-is« (Goldie 2011,
         305): when the reader imagines the <span class="Emphasis">situation</span> in which Anna acts and infers the burden of distress that she feels.<span id="Note16_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="Goldie stresses that such a process of »imagining-how-it-is«, which often occurs when reading fiction, is not a true empathetic response, since it do…" href="#Note16">[16]</a></span> But if »the ethically significant activity« of the reading process involves empathy
         (Gregory 2010, 293), then we must ask if it is possible to imagine <span class="Emphasis">being</span> Anna in that situation. Can we truly adopt Anna’s inside point of view and share
         her deep feelings? We think that an answer of »yes« to these questions involves an
         essential blindness to the barriers that separate the reader from others – in this
         case from the concreteness of Anna Karenina’s life. This raises a crucial question:
         if, in fact, it is not possible to achieve a true empathetic response – that is, to
         truly adopt Anna’s perspective, to imagine being her – then what constitutes the ethical
         reading?
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">To cope with this question, we turn to Emmanuel Levinas, whose philosophical writings
         offer a theoretical perspective for reconsidering the complexities of the empathetic
         response. In <span class="Emphasis">Totality and Infinity</span> Levinas criticizes the Western philosophical quest for total knowledge of Being and
         condemns it as the »imperialism of the same« (Levinas 2002, 87). The imperialistic
         project is due to the subject’s search for coherent structures of meaning, conducted
         by subordinating the particular to the general and reducing the unknown to the framework
         of »sameness« (cf. ibid., 42–48). Such a reduction also happens in a relationship
         between two people, when one party approaches the other with his thinking apparatus
         and tries to know and comprehend the other. According to Levinas, comprehension necessarily
         involves comparison to the self. This idea points to the risks of ethical reading
         that advocates an empathetic understanding of another person’s mind. The risk is that
         instead of being oriented toward the other, the reader is actually projecting his
         or her thoughts, feelings and desires onto the imagined other, while violently ignoring
         the differences between them. When engaging in such projection, the reader is liable
         to ignore signs of suffering and distress that are outside his frame of reference.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">Significantly, Levinas’s notion of alterity is carefully distinguished from the common
         understanding of the other as relational to the self (cf. Levinas 2002, 203). Levinas
         argues that <span class="Emphasis">Autrui</span> is not an oppositional concept that functions as an essential constituent of self-consciousness.
         Rather, human otherness signifies a radical uniqueness that cannot be conceptualized,
         thematized or comprehended, that can never be summed up or reduced to any one general
         structure or set of attributes (cf. ibid., 73). According to this perspective, imagining
         being another person involves a denial of the special uniqueness that characterizes
         every human being and of »the radical separation between the same and the other« (ibid.,
         36). For Levinas, it is this radical separation that ethically affects the subject
         and obligates him or her with an unconditional responsibility towards the other.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->Thus, in opposition to theories of empathy, Levinas’s conceptualization of subjectivity
         does not assume that the self can truly simulate another person’s subjective experience,
         nor does it assume that the self can successfully perform the »imaginative project
         that requires a full understanding of the target’s mental states« (Coplan/Goldie 2011b,
         v). Corresponding with postmodern attacks on the knowing subject, Levinas suggests
         a subject who is always already bound up with an »other« who is somehow unknown, towards
         whom the subject is totally indebted, without having any conscious, rational intention
         or free will. In Levinas’s thinking, ethical relations with another person do not
         depend on knowledge or understanding, but instead involve a welcome of the unknown
         and the incomprehensible. In these ethical relations, the concrete face of the other,
         who »resists possession, resists my powers« (Levinas 2002, 197), does not invite me
         to an empathetic identification, but rather shakes my world, disturbs »the being at
         home with oneself« (ibid., 39) and obligates me with unchosen responsibility for her.
         The ethical challenge is, then, to encounter the other person as a radical alterity,
         totally exterior and inaccessible, and nonetheless acknowledge the obligation towards
         her and be able to hear her call for help.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">In addition to criticizing the notion that knowledge and understanding of another
         person are possible, Levinas’s writing provides an illuminating perspective regarding
         the specific problems of empathy in relation to art. In an early essay, »Reality and
         Its Shadow«, Levinas condemns art as »the very event of obscuring, a descent of the
         night, an invasion of shadow« (Levinas 1989, 132).<span id="Note17_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="On Levinas’s negative approach to art, see Eaglestone 1997, 98–125; Robbins 1999, 75–90.

         distorted, deceiving and delightful, these illusions act like sleight-of-hand magic
         or rhythmic melody, imposing themselves on the consuming subject who »is caught up
         and carried away by [them]« (ibid., 132). Though Levinas makes no direct reference
         to the ethics of reading, his notion of artistic representation as a delusion in which
         distorted images efface the real is echoed in his later criticism of the effacement
         of alterity by the structures of the »Same«. According to this criticism, empathetic
         reading catalyzed by fictional art involves a delusive effacement of the distance
         between the reader and the fictional character. It is the power of fiction to recruit
         the imagination – in ways that involve deep emotional engagement with the artwork
         – and to make the reader believe in delusive ideas, that creates a special danger
         for the relations between the self and the other, even more than day-to-day encounters
         in the real world. This is because fiction gives the reader the illusion that she
         is actually entering a character’s mind, achieving »a genuine understanding of another
         person’s feelings, thoughts and character« (Gregory 2010, 293).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">This illusion echoes the dream of »fusion« that Levinas criticizes in his essay »The
         Other in Proust«: »the idea that duality should be transformed into unity – that the
         social relation should end in communion« (Levinas 1996, 104). For Levinas, such a
         dream consists of the suspension of alterity, the unethical disrespect for the difference
         that escapes the possessive grasp of the reading subject. Thus, while striving to
         simulate the inside experience of a literary characters, empathetic reading becomes
         unethical, since it involves (even if unconsciously) an essential disregard for the
         inaccessible singularity of the other’s experience.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">In light of these concerns, we propose a new form of ethical criticism that leans
         on a basic suspicion towards the notion of empathy and empathetic identification.
         We suggest that, particularly in the globalized world of the 21st century, ethical
         criticism must take into account the ethical demands that arise when we face a radical
         stranger: the other whose feelings and thoughts we cannot enter yet who nonetheless
         demands responsiveness and responsibility from us. In a global world, empathy is not
         only impossible to achieve – if we mean it to involve a true reconstruction of the
         subjective experience of another person – but is a dangerous concept that obscures
         our obligation to those people who are not similar to us. Therefore, our notion of
         
         <!--
                       p. -->ethical reading demands that the incomprehensible other be allowed to remain singular
         and unexplained. Instead of attempting to obtain knowledge and an empathetic understanding,
         it strives to detect modes of distress and suffering that escape the scope of familiarity
         and the framework of comprehensible meanings.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">Our proposed ethical criticism comprises two major elements: First, using close reading
         and deconstructionist methodologies, it explores the cultural and linguistic mechanisms
         that elicit perceived categories of »likeness« or »otherness«. It questions the »knowable«
         and engages in a textual struggle to prevent the reader from excluding and marginalizing
         those who do not seem »similar« or »understandable« to her. Second, like feminist
         and postcolonial approaches, our ethical criticism strives to reach forms of vulnerability
         and distress that elude conventional representation. By unsettling the process of
         empathetic response that literary texts often evoke, such a reading rejects commonplace
         images of otherness and acknowledges nameless conditions of suffering and neglected
         subjectivities. These two elements are combined in the main question that guides our
         ethical reading: how can the subject attend to the other and act – to use the Levinasian
         terminology – »for-another« without professing to <span class="Emphasis">be</span> the other?
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">4 Atwood’s <span style="font-style:italic">Alias Grace</span> and the Practice of Ethical Criticism
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">Let us elaborate on our proposed concept of ethical criticism through a reading of
         Margaret Atwood’s <span class="Emphasis">Alias Grace</span> (1996). This novel not only exemplifies the tendency of fictional art to invite readers
         into relations of empathy with its characters but also provides opportunities to challenge
         the mechanism by which readers categorize characters as »similar« and to recognize
         the price of ignoring differences. These opportunities stem in part from the nature
         of the novel’s protagonist, a convicted murderer, who, like some other literary criminals
         and murderers (for example, Raskolnikov of Dostoyevsky’s <span class="Emphasis">Crime and Punishment</span>, Humbert of Nabokov’s <span class="Emphasis">Lolita</span>, or Hanna of Schlink’s<span class="Emphasis">The Reader</span>) presents the readers with extreme and irrevocable deeds that invite moral judgment
         but at the same time elude definitive comprehension and thwart any categorical conclusion.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">The novel <span class="Emphasis">Alias Grace </span>reconstructs a famous real-life murder affair in 19th-century Canada, in which a sixteen-year-old
         maid, Grace Marks, and her fellow-servant, James McDermott, were tried and convicted
         for the murder of their household employer, Thomas Kinnear, and his housekeeper Nancy
         Montgomery. Both servants were condemned to death, but Grace’s sentence was commuted
         to imprisonment. Grace spent more than 30 years in prison, in addition to a few years
         in a lunatic asylum, until she was pardoned and released in 1872. Atwood’s novel recounts
         the gothic affair, combining known facts from available records with fictional elaborations
         of the events, and focuses, as its title indicates, on the mysterious identity (»Alias«)
         of Grace – mysterious because, as Atwood explains in the afterword to the novel, »[t]he
         true character of the historical Grace Marks«, who attracted much attention at the
         time, »remains an enigma« (Atwood 1996, 463). In spite of the guilty verdict, the
         nature of Grace’s actual involvement in the murder was never definitively established;
         the press presented many different accounts, polarizing public opinion concerning
         her.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">The novel includes various texts that reflect the enormous interest that Grace aroused
         even years after the trial: poems that were written about Grace; Susanna Moodie’s
         descriptions of the affair, published in her <span class="Emphasis">Life in the Clearings</span> (1853); newspaper articles; and medical accounts written by Grace’s doctors. The
         novel also incorporates documents from the Kingston penitentiary and segments of the
         historical confessions of the accused. The main fictive element of the novel is Grace’s
         first-person account, told to the fictional Dr. Simon Jordan, whose mission is to
         explore Grace’s mind (since she claims to have forgotten what really happened on 
         <!--
                       p. -->the day of the murder) and to find answers to the factual questions surrounding her
         involvement in the crime. The merging of the various texts builds the detective plot
         of the novel and stages Grace as an object of constant examination and speculation.
         Her character is rendered through the inquisitive eyes that scrutinize her, driven
         by the common desire to decipher her personality and figure out who she really is:
         »an inhuman female demon« or »an innocent victim of a blackguard forced against [her]
         will and in danger of [her] life« (Atwood 1996, 23)? The desire to solve Grace’s mystery
         is embodied in the fictional character of Simon, the representative of rational knowledge,
         who is sent to recover Grace’s memory: »to probe down below the threshold of her consciousness,
         and to discover the memories that must perforce lie buried there« (ibid., 132). For
         him, Grace seems like »a locked box, to which [he] must find the right key« (ibid.,
         138).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">However, in Atwood’s fictional world there is no »right key« to the mystery of the
         past, nor to the mystery of an individual psyche. Simon’s quest for univocal truth
         fails, and the reader’s desire for a final resolution to the detective plot is frustrated.
         Grace remains elusive, and the ghostly revelation of her second self, who claims to
         have committed the murder, constitutes a strange, »rationally unacceptable« solution
         to the murder case (Staels 2000, 432). The irrational revelation happens in the scene
         of Grace’s hypnotic confession, in which she speaks with the voice of her dead friend
         Mary Whitney and declares that Mary is the true murderer – as a ghost that entered
         Grace’s body. Is this unexpected confession a performance that Grace enacts? Or does
         she truly suffer from some kind of split personality? Or was it indeed a ghost that
         committed the murder? The novel leaves these questions unanswered, and Grace herself
         »remains a secret« (Lopez 2012, 169).<span id="Note18_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="On the critics’ different opinions concerning the possible answers see Niederhoff 2006–2007, 76–77." href="#Note18">[18]</a></span></p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">The dominant critical approach to the novel emphasizes its postmodern rejection of
         the notion of »›truth‹ as universal, transcendent, fixed« (Michael 2001, 438), and
         the consequent embracement of »the impossibility of knowing the truth« (Niederhoff
         2006–2007, 77). The ethical reading we propose does not stop with the novel’s rejection
         of truth, but rather focuses attention on the interlinking between the pursuit of
         truth – upheld both by the fictional characters and by the curious readers – and the
         ethics of empathy, which the novel evokes but also unsettles. We suggest looking at
         <span class="Emphasis">Alias Grace</span> as a complex questioning of the empathetic position and its interrelations with knowing,
         violence and the effacing of difference. In our reading it becomes clear that empathy
         goes hand in hand with the requirement to know Grace and with the attempt to understand
         who she really is. The problem is that the process of obtaining knowledge of an individual’s
         mind is reductive, aggressive and grounded in oppressive power-relations. Furthermore,
         to reach an empathetic understanding, readers must reconstruct the image of Grace
         so that she seems »like them« in some crucial aspects, a person whose identity is
         stable and coherent and with whom it is possible to identify. In this way we lose
         sight of Grace’s singularity. An empathetic reading cannot welcome Grace’s elusive
         subjectivity and face the suffering she articulates.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">The invitation to empathy arises from Grace’s first-person narration and her interior
         monologues, which appeal to the readers and encourage the process of perspective-shifting
         towards her. Such an empathetic perspective-shifting seems to be the ethical answer
         that opposes the social exclusion of Grace and her status as an ultimate inferior
         other. Grace is not only an outcast criminal accused of murder but also an Irish immigrant
         to Canada, an abused woman in the patriarchal culture of the mid-19th-century; she
         is a poor servant in a capitalist society and suffers from frantic outbursts. Thus,
         as Maria Lopez notes, Grace is represented as belonging to »the marginal communities
         of immigrants, servants, and mad people« (Lopez 2012, 157), and, as Grace herself
         recognizes, she functions as »an object of fear, like a spider, and of charity as
         well« (Atwood 1996, 22).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->In her conversations with Simon, Grace forms her own autobiography and thus counters
         the image of an insane or cruel murderess. Her touching account reveals her miserable
         childhood, her traumatic journey to Canada, the brutal behavior of her father, the
         loss of her mother, the hardships of her employment in the new country, and the trauma
         of seeing her friend Mary Whitney bleeding to death after an abortion. As Marie-Thérèse
         Blanc writes, Grace’s first-person recounting of her life story »constitutes a <span class="Emphasis">counter</span>narrative to the novel’s collected narratives of her arraignment for murder, of her
         trial, of her post-trial confession, and of her conviction and incarceration« (Blanc
         2006, 106, italics in the original). Blanc’s argument is that with Grace’s personal
         narrative the novel »asks its readers to debate legal narrativity itself« (ibid.).
         We suggest that Grace’s focalized personal narration of her life story fulfills another
         role in her relations with both Simon and the reader – it invites them to empathize
         with her, to enter her point of view and simulate her subjective experience.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">Empathy is invited not only by the personal themes of Grace’s story and the technique
         of focalization but also by the many concrete details that fill Grace’s narration
         of her material experience. Thus, for example, when Grace tells Simon about her awful
         trip to Canada, she makes her story sensible and vivid, describing the »greasy ladder«
         in the ship, the exact details of the »rough wooden slabs« on which the family slept
         (Atwood 1996, 113), and the terrible »stench« at night that »was enough to turn your
         stomach inside out« (ibid., 116). As she shares these meticulously detailed memories
         with her listener, Grace turns to Simon, mindful of the strong impression that her
         story is making on him, and says: »Perhaps you would like to open the window« (ibid.).
         This phrase reveals the implicit invitation that lies in her narration, to enter her
         perspective and achieve the empathetic position of imagining <span class="Emphasis">becoming</span> Grace. Indeed, imagining ourselves in the stifling hold of the ship, in Grace’s position,
         we indeed might feel it necessary to open a window and breathe in some fresh air.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">Grace’s interior monologues, which reveal her intimate thoughts and feelings, further
         invite the reader to empathy. These monologues, most of which are presented in conjunction
         with Grace’s meetings with Simon (before, during and after), encourage the reader
         to reconstruct Grace’s subjective experience from within. For example, in one meeting
         Grace ruminates on the smell of Simon’s English shaving soap, thinking that »[i]t
         is a reassuring smell and I always look forward to it« (ibid., 97). The voicing of
         Grace’s inner world presents a challenge to the conventional 19th-century representation
         of female killers as monstrously evil or insane, an image conveyed in some of the
         text excerpts included in the novel, such as that of Susanna Moodie. Moodie’s text
         depicts Grace as insane, her face »lighted up with the fire of insanity, and glowing
         with a hideous and fiend-like-merriment« (ibid., 45). In contrast, Grace’s internal
         perspective establishes her as sane, aware and cultivated, a well-spoken woman who
         even remembers reading Walter Scott (cf. ibid., 247). As Niederhoff writes on Grace’s
         narration: »Grace comes across as a compassionate, reliable and sensible woman, the
         last person on earth we would suspect of committing the murders she has been charged
         with« (Niederhoff 2000, 77).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">Yet, this observation highlights a crucial point in our criticism of empathy as a
         basis for ethical reading: the invitation of the reader to undergo an empathetic shift
         in perspective towards Grace implies a removal of the disturbing aspects from her
         character. It means choosing one acceptable version of Grace – that of her image while
         talking with Simon and confessing her thoughts to the readers – and putting aside
         all the other constructions of her character that the novel provides, which relate
         her to the murder. This removal and the portrayal of the speaking Grace as a gentle
         and cultivated woman, whose voice is »low and melodious« (Atwood 1996, 133) and whose
         hands are busy with patchwork quilting, make her seem like an appropriate domestic
         version of femininity, or »as a sort of unpaid servant« (ibid., 54), who has become
         a victim of harsh circumstances. This manner of encoding Grace’s character and framing
         her 
         <!--
                       p. -->narrative allows the reader to allocate Grace into the category of »likeness«; it
         establishes a reasonable and comprehensible identity for Grace that enables the reader
         to perform the imaginative leap of empathetic perspective-shifting. With this empathetic
         development, the reader, together with Simon, may reach the elevated liberal position
         of compassionate understanding of the poor woman instead of staying in the unpleasant
         state of total confusion and uncertainty concerning her true nature.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">However, the novel disrupts this process of empathetic perspective-shifting, and we
         suggest that this disruption bears ethical significance. The disruption is achieved
         not only by blocking Grace’s inner world when it comes to the murder affair, but also
         by warning the readers time and again that she may be telling lies or simply inventing
         engaging stories like »Scheherazade« (ibid., 377).<span id="Note19_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="On Grace as a sophisticated storyteller see Stein 1999, 107–109." href="#Note19">[19]</a></span> This framing suggests that Grace is employing manipulative rhetoric to evoke empathy,
         a trap Grace’s audience – Simon and the readers – fall into as a result of their desire
         to achieve the rewarding position of the moral subject who empathizes with the poor
         girl.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">The ethical reading we pursue further calls attention to the violence that is involved
         in the process of establishing empathy with Grace. As the plot unfolds it becomes
         clear that empathy is dependent on our ability (and Simon’s) to look into Grace’s
         inner world and organize a coherent story around her, based on stable and comprehensible
         foundations. Indeed, theories of empathy assert that close knowledge of the other
         is a necessary condition for empathizing with him (cf. Coplan 2011, 13). However,
         <span class="Emphasis">Alias Grace</span> also reveals that the process of obtaining a close knowledge of the other and forcing
         her to produce a coherent, intelligible story is violent and oppressive, a process
         that cannot serve as a starting point for an ethical relationship with the other.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">The violence is prominent in Simon’s quest for the truth about Grace, as implied by
         the many metaphors that describe his relations with her. For example, Simon tries
         »to open her [Grace] like an oyster« (Atwood 1996, 133), and wonders »whether Grace
         will at last crack open […] or whether she will instead take fright and hide, and
         shut herself up like a clam.« (ibid., 307). Simon is aware of the »dark« sides of
         his profession and thinks about how »he has opened up women’s bodies, and peered inside«
         (ibid., 82). His desire to »open up« Grace’s mind seems to be just another stage in
         this violent project of gaining knowledge of the human species, which Simon views
         as essential to 19th-century progression (ibid., 300). Later, when Simon becomes discouraged
         in his lack of progress in deciphering Grace’s mind, he thinks that »Knowledge of
         guilt, or else of innocence: either could be concealed. But he’ll pry it out of her
         yet. He’s got the hook in her mouth« (ibid., 322).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">Critics have referred to the obsessiveness that characterizes Simon’s treatment of
         Grace, his sexual fantasies of overpowering her, and his assertion of exploitive patterns
         with other women (Niederhoff 2000, 80; Rao 2009–2010, 74). Indeed, as the plot evolves
         and Simon’s violent impulses are revealed, the reader’s sympathies towards him dissipate.
         The common opposition between violence and empathy might imply that Simon’s aggressive
         pursuit of Grace’s nature contradicts the empathetic position. Yet our ethical criticism
         demands that we deconstruct this opposition and acknowledge that, in fact, Simon’s
         violence is an integral component of his desire to understand Grace’s inner mind,
         a desire that the reader, drawn in by Grace’s narration, shares as well. It is not
         enough to criticize Simon’s conduct without taking into account that our own interest
         in Grace implies that we, too, desire to obtain stable knowledge about her and to
         achieve a reductive decoding of her personality. We, too, seek a final, single answer
         to the question of Grace’s guilt, try to extract such an answer from her multilayered
         story, and want »what she refuses to tell« – a truth concerning either her guilt or
         her innocence (Atwood 1996, 322).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">
         <!--
                       p. -->Furthermore, in our attempt to achieve the empathetic position, we might tend to concentrate
         on Grace’s traumatic history and reconstruct her image as an obvious victim – otherwise
         how could we empathize with her?<span id="Note20_return"><a class="Hyperlink notelink" title="The emphasis of Grace’s traumatic trials is very prominent; see Howells 2000, 152–153; Stein 1999, 108." href="#Note20">[20]</a></span> In the novel, such an approach is reflected by characters such as Reverend Verringer,
         who defend Grace, attempting to arouse empathy and compassion for her, viewing her
         as an innocent victim. However, the empathetic position on which Reverend Verringer
         leans is revealed to be very limited in its ability to actually help Grace, since
         it depends on »the theory of innocence«, (ibid., 77) which the expert opinion of Dr.
         Simon purports to sustain. Yet, although Simon himself comes to feel compassion for
         Grace (ibid., 320) and even »wants her to be vindicated« (ibid., 322), he withdraws
         and flees when her mysterious second self appears. Empathy and compassion cannot be
         sustained when the target eludes definitive identity and remains, as Simon describes
         Grace in a letter, an »enigmatic mirage« (ibid., 424).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">The postmodern ethical reading we promote requires that we consider the ethical responsibility
         towards those others whose identity escapes definitive categorization, while taking
         into account the secrecy that lies at the core of our relations with another person.
         An ethics of empathy implies that when empathy fails – as in the case of Grace, who
         ultimately eludes empathetic understanding – there is nothing more to do in ethical
         terms: we come to a dead end in our relations with Grace. In opposition to such an
         approach, we suggest posing the question that Simon and other characters who handle
         Grace’s case do not dare to ask: what is my obligation to those persons outside the
         scope of similarity and empathy? What am I to do to respond to a person like Grace,
         whose cry for help does not go hand in hand with a potential for empathetic understanding?
         The ethical reading that we propose demands that we renounce the question of <span class="Emphasis">who </span>Grace Marks is and welcome her as she is, with the wide range of undetermined possibilities
         – a decent woman and a murderess, a talented storyteller and a trickster, a victim
         and a manipulator – without excluding those features that are unpleasant, irrational
         or incomprehensible, and without forcing them into a coherent story in which they
         all fit together.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">In this context, it is notable that although the novel includes many different kinds
         of texts – medical, poetical, journalistic and legal – that describe Grace’s character,
         all texts reduce the richness of her personality to a single theme: her involvement
         in the murder. By refusing the novel’s pursuit of truth and the common binary opposition
         this pursuit assumes – the opposition between strong condemnation and an empathetic
         understanding of Grace – the reader can refuse to collaborate in reproducing Grace’s
         thematization and her historical objectification. This approach also enables us to
         notice that by concentrating on the question of Grace’s guilt and on her past actions,
         the various texts generate blindness towards the cruel conditions of her present time,
         in which she is incarcerated in prison. These conditions almost escape our attention
         because we are so involved in deciphering Grace’s mind and solving the questions surrounding
         her exact involvement in the crime. We suggest that regardless of whether or not Grace
         is indeed a criminal, whether she has a history of traumatic victimization or is only
         inventing this history in her narration, whether or not she is sane – the important
         ethical point is to recognize her as a subject to whom we are indebted and, while
         refusing the temptation of empathy, to acknowledge her concrete suffering: Grace is
         isolated and starved in jail (cf. ibid., 34–35); she is sexually abused (cf. ibid.,
         79, 240), deprived of sunlight (cf. ibid., 237), and subjected to beating and pinching
         (cf. ibid., 239).
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">Our notion of ethical criticism, inspired by Levinas, addresses the impossibility
         of achieving full understanding of either real persons or fictional characters. It
         demands an attentive awareness to the ways in which we tend to construct and reconstruct
         categories of similarities and indulge in the position of empathetic identification
         with those who seem similar to us. This is indeed the responsibility of the reader
         as she interprets a text: to refuse the position of empathy and develop an awareness
         of its blind spots and dangers. As we have shown, in <span class="Emphasis">Alias 
            <!--
                       p. -->Grace</span> the process of empathetic perspective-shifting involves a reshaping of the protagonist
         so that she comes to fit a certain acceptable image of womanhood. Our analysis also
         reveals that this process is intertwined with the violence of getting to know Grace,
         and that it fails when the impossibility of attaining such knowledge is established,
         that is, empathy is revealed to be blocked when the personality of the other evades
         definition and understanding. However, an incomprehensible person may also be suffering
         and in need of help, and the ethical reading we suggest advocates recognition of such
         suffering and the human obligation to help the sufferer, no matter who she is.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_ZwischenueberschriftNummeriert1">5 Conclusions</p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">Ethical literary criticism is a dynamic field of study whose evolution is intimately
         intertwined with historical changes in the philosophical conceptualization of ethics
         and with cultural inquiries concerning subjectivity and social relations. While the
         last decades have presented a profound challenge to traditional ethical criticism,
         it is certainly not yet time to mourn the death of ethical criticism altogether. In
         this article we have argued that the postmodern notions of uncertainty and indeterminacy
         are not destructive to the field of ethical criticism, even though they demand its
         rethinking. We believe that such a rethinking and a reexamination of our basic assumptions
         and inclinations concerning ethical reading are crucial for rejuvenating the field
         of ethical criticism.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_JLT_Haupttext">We have presented such a reexamination in our approach to the idea of empathy, by
         challenging it as a basis for ethical reading while offering a new approach to ethical
         criticism in the 21st century. We showed that instead of looking back and rehabilitating
         the ethical tradition of empathetic reading, we can find in Levinas’s philosophy a
         potential means of reconsidering the relations between ethics and literature. Elaborating
         on Levinas’s ethics, we called into question the idea that true empathy is possible
         and the assumption that simulating the inner perspective of the other is an ethical
         process of reading. Instead, we argued for casting suspicion on the category of »sameness«,
         suggesting that doing so facilitates a new understanding of the responsibilities of
         the reader. Since we regard fictional reading as a day-to-day real-life activity,
         we believe that a deep consideration of the subject’s responsibility to the others
         she encounters in fictional texts is an important ethical undertaking. As our detailed
         example of the reading of <span style="font-style:italic">Alias Grace</span> reveals, this is not only a theoretical idea, but a call for a specific process of
         reading, one that involves a constant mistrust of the reader’s inclination to achieve
         an empathetic identification with the other. In our view, the ethical crux of reading
         is to acknowledge the suffering of the other without appropriating him or losing sight
         of his singularity. We are certain that further development of this consideration
         through the analysis of different texts and various situations of personal and social
         encounters will ensure that ethical criticism remains an important and productive
         pursuit of literary studies.

                  rejection of ethical judgments in the scholarly analysis of literature in postmodernism
                  and post-structuralism.« (Groeben 2011, 131) Groeben then adds: »In my view, this

               in a certain situation which the fiction describes, imagining ourselves to have the
               same relevant beliefs, desires and values as the character whose situation it is.
               […] That way we learn something about the character. More importantly from the point
               of view of moral knowledge, we learn something about ourselves and about the things
               we regard, or might regard, as putative values.« (Currie 1995, 257) See also Colin

               from Coetzee’s Disgrace (1999). As a loving father and as a professor of literature,
               skilled with the habit of empathetic reading, he feels himself »capable of imagining«
               his daughter’s experience and even »suffering with her«, after they have both been
               violently attacked by strangers (Coetzee 1999, 140). The novel, however, shows that
               Lurie’s pretension of an empathetic understanding only distances him from his daughter,
               from an understanding of her suffering and from the possibility of truly helping her.

               reading fiction, is not a true empathetic response, since it does not involve entering

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">A large part of literary studies is concerned with interpreting literary works. Controversial
         issues in literary theory include the very goals of literary interpretation, its methods,
         and standards of correctness. Moreover, in recent times there has been some interest
         in potential discrepancies between theoretical assumptions on interpretation and interpretive
         practice. Most literary scholars as well as theorists will probably agree that the
         basic aim of interpretation is to facilitate our understanding of a work by uncovering
         its meaning. However, this ›semantic‹ approach to interpretation could be biased.
         In particular, it does not sit well with a picture of the literary work as an object
         of the reader’s aesthetic pleasure, aesthetic experience, literary appreciation, or
         ›immersion‹. Call this the ›aesthetic‹ approach to interpretation. Against this backdrop,
         interpretation could be said to have the basic aim to facilitate, or probably even
         maximize, the reader’s aesthetic pleasure, aesthetic experience, etc. Now, while some
         theorists (including Susan Sontag in her much celebrated »Against Interpretation«)
         think that the ›semantic‹ and the ›aesthetic‹ approaches to interpretation are irreconcilable,
         others have argued that they may be complementary, or that they belong to different
         realms, such as scholarly work vs. personal life.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">JLT invites papers on topics that include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
         <li class="item">Enquiries into the history of literary studies: which conceptions of interpretation
            belong to the ›semantic‹ approach, or to the ›aesthetic‹ approach, respectively?
         </li>
         <li class="item">What are the theoretical background assumptions of either approach (from e.g., semiotics,
            aesthetics, the theory of art or language)?
         </li>
         <li class="item">Conceptions of ›meaning‹, ›understanding‹, ›aesthetic experience‹, ›aesthetic pleasure‹,
            etc.
         </li>
         <li class="item">Conceptions of the experiential side of reading, such as ›experientiality‹, ›immersion‹,
            ›transportation‹, and their relation to conceptions of ›meaning‹ or ›work meaning‹
         </li>
         <li class="item">What place does aesthetic experience have in literary interpretation (e.g., goal,
            criterion, precondition)?
         </li>
         <li class="item">Can interpretations according to either the ›semantic‹ or the ›aesthetic‹ approach
            be scholarly (or even scientifically) rigorous?
         </li>
         <li class="item">What is the relation between aesthetic experience and aesthetic appreciation?</li>
         <li class="item">
            <!--
                       p. -->Can there be a study of interpretive practice according to either the ›semantic‹ or
            the ›aesthetic‹ approach?
         </li>
         <li class="item">Enquiries into the psychology of (aspects of) reading according to the ›semantic‹
            or ›aesthetic‹ approaches to interpretation
         </li>

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">We encourage submissions from all language and literature departments as well as neighboring
         disciplines, e.g. the philosophy of art, media studies, art history, and musicology.
         Articles in which individual literary texts or a corpus of literary texts are interpreted
         can only be considered if they feature a strong focus on systematic and theoretical
         questions.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Contributions should not exceed 50,000 characters in length and have to be submitted
         by <span style="font-weight:bold">1 September 2019</span>. Please submit your contribution electronically via our website <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.jltonline.de">www.jltonline.de</a> under »Articles«.

         review process.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">JLT aims to publish work on fundamental issues in methodology and the construction
         of theories and concepts, as well as articles on particular literary theories. Case
         studies, i.e. studies on specific authors, works, or problems of literary history,
         are accepted only if they adopt a predominantly systematic perspective, contribute
         to the reconstruction of the history of literary theory, or pursue innovative methods.
         Moreover, the Journal of Literary Theory contains work reviewing and outlining trends
         of theoretical debates in literary theory and related disciplines.

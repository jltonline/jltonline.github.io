      <p>At least since the establishment of praxeological research, ›theory‹ and ›practice‹
         have no longer been conceived as categorical opposites. As Steffen Martus and Carlos
         Spoerhase claim, »[a]gainst the dichotomy of practice and theory runs the suggestion
         that contemplating, reflecting, or even theorizing themselves are already activities«
         (2022, 173sq.). Praxeological research has proven from various perspectives that theoretical
         speaking can be described as ›theorizing‹ and thus also as practice (e.g., Schmidt
         2016). This, of course, also applies to theorizing about literature.
      </p>
      <p>This <span style="font-style:italic">JLT</span> issue welcomes contributions that address the topic of »the practice of literary
         theory« from a theoretical, praxeological, or historical perspective. While some guiding
         questions are listed below, they are intended more broadly as prompts to stimulate
         introspection:
      </p>
      <p>(1) How can a concept of ›literary theory as practice‹ be spelled out <span style="font-style:italic">theoretically</span>? What are the consequences of modifying the established pair of opposites ›theory
         versus practice‹ or even the triad ›theory – method – practical application‹? Is a
         self-observation or a self-reflection about literary theory sufficient, or is a particular
         praxeology necessary? What strategies of inclusion and exclusion do theoretical approaches,
         e.g., theories of interpretation, pursue with regard to accepted objects, procedures,
         and ways of speaking? What might be the ›implicit logic‹ and <span style="font-style:italic">tricks of the trade</span> (Becker 1998) for theorizing about literature, and what kind of ›literacy‹ comes
         into play?
      </p>
      <p>(2) With a <span style="font-style:italic">praxeological</span> focus, one might ask: How is theorizing done? Are there – following e.g., Fleck or
         Hacking – different ›styles of literary theory‹, i.e., common and distinguishable
         ways of dealing with literary theory topics? If so, what are they? And how exactly
         do such styles differ, e.g., in the treatment of literary theoretical terms, such
         as ›literature‹, ›meaning‹, or ›interpreting‹? Can we identify different styles of
         argumentation? What sociological factors are to be reckoned with when it comes to
         implementing theories? How can far-reaching praxeological perspectives – beyond the
         verbal production of theoretical statements, for example, as a material, technique-related
         and bodily dimension of actions – be transformed into specific investigations?
      </p>
      <p>(3) Which positions and developments in the history of a discipline can be traced
         historically with regards to the formation of literary theories, the carrying out
         of theoretical debates, and the discussion of concepts and procedures? From this perspective,
         individual positions could be reconstructed synchronically and examined for their
         characteristics and strategies of presentation. Or, diachronically, one could ask
         about tendencies that have emerged, prevailed, or simply failed to prevail in different
         phases of theory formation. Why did they prevail or not? What role do networks, citation
         communities, and contexts of specific ›schools‹ play? How might the disruptions and
         continuities in the history of theory be viewed differently when literary theory is
         recognized as practice?
      </p>
      <p class="no">We welcome contributions from literary studies and neighbouring disciplines that address
         these (and further) questions related to the practice of literary theory.

      <p class="No Spacing">JLT aims to publish work on fundamental issues in methodology and the construction
         of theories and concepts, as well as articles on particular literary theories. Case
         studies, i.e. studies on specific authors, works, or problems of literary history,
         are accepted only if they adopt a predominantly systematic perspective, contribute
         to the reconstruction of the history of literary theory, or pursue innovative methods.
         Moreover, the Journal of Literary Theory contains work reviewing and outlining trends
         of theoretical debates in literary theory and related disciplines.

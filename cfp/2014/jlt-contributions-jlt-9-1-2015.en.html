    <p class="Termin">Submission Deadline: August 1, 2014</p>
    <p class="CfP">CALL FOR ARTICLES</p>
    <p class="Absatz">Empirical methods have a humble yet continuous tradition in literary studies. It’s a tradition that seems to stand in fundamental opposition to historical and hermeneutical approaches due to differences concerning the practice of validation, reliability and extensiveness of their claims. JLT is interested in publishing articles that take a theoretical and systematic perspective on the question how empirical methods — despite those differences — might fit into the research practices of literary studies. How can both approaches complement each other? How can established questions in literary studies be answered differently (or maybe even more satisfyingly) by using empirical approaches? How does literature as a subject matter change through the use of empirical approaches, such as methods from the cognitive sciences or computer based processes? Which preconditions should (still) be clarified, so that empirical methods can become part of the literary studies?</p>
    <p class="Absatz">We encourage submissions from all language and literature departments as well as other fields within the humanities and social sciences.</p>

    <p class="Absatz">SUBMISSIONS THAT DO NOT FOCUS ON ONE OF OUR SPECIAL TOPICS CAN BE SUBMITTED CONTINUOUSLY VIA OUR WEBSITE.</p>
    <p class="Absatz">JLT aims to publish work on fundamental issues in methodology and the construction of theories and concepts, as well as articles on particular literary theories. Case studies, i.e. studies on specific authors, works, or problems of literary history, are accepted only if they adopt a predominantly systematic perspective, contribute to the reconstruction of the history of literary theory, or pursue innovative methods. Moreover, the Journal of Literary Theory contains work reviewing and outlining trends of theoretical debates in literary theory and related disciplines.</p>
    <p class="Absatz">Please contact the editorial office if you have further questions.</p>

      <p class="No Spacing"><span style="font-weight:bold">Special Issue »Literary Theory and the Network Turn«</span></p>
      <p class="No Spacing"><span style="font-weight:bold">Submission Deadline: 15 January 2023</span></p>
      <p class="No Spacing"><span style="font-weight:bold">Call for Articles</span></p>
      <p class="No Spacing">Within the past few decades, key developments in literary theory have been shaped
         by different cultural turns (e. g. the spatial turn, the visual turn, the translational
         turn, cf. Bachmann-Medick 2016). The implications of the most recent one – the network
         turn –, heralded by Ruth Ahnert et al. in their recent book <span style="font-style:italic">The Network Turn: Changing Perspectives in the Humanities</span>, however, still need to be discussed. Taking the observation that »we live in a networked
         world« as starting point, Ahnert et al. aim to promote new modes of network analysis,
         which they define as »a set of practices and discourses that sit at the interface
         of the natural sciences, humanities, social sciences, computer science, and design«
         (Ahnert 2020, 4). Moving beyond this approach, which is geared towards »bringing together
         computational tools for quantitative network analysis, together with theories, discourses,
         and applied techniques from the social sciences, the humanities, visual design, and
         art practice« (ibid.), <span style="font-style:italic">JLT </span>invites contributions that discuss potential implications of ›the network turn‹ on
         methods and theories in literary studies. While we welcome contributions which connect
         to current approaches that combine micro- and macroanalyses (cf. Jockers 2013), the
         thematic spectrum envisaged for this issue is not restricted to the impact of DH-driven
         methods on literary theory, nor is it limited to discussions of the fruitfulness of
         actor-network theory for literary studies. Instead, the aim is to explore the potential
         of a ›network turn‹ at a broader scope and discuss various networked approaches that
         might aid the advancement of (current approaches in) literary theory. Or, to adopt
         Rita Felski’s questions that she poses when discussing the ›value‹ of Latourian thought
         for literary studies, »What duels, rivalries, appropriations, or love affairs will
         ensue?« (2015, 737)
      </p>
      <p class="No Spacing">It seems commonplace that the complexity of literary theory requires a networked approach.
         This is confirmed by new areas of research prompted by bridging disciplinary boundaries,
         such as cognitive literary studies, literary animal studies or ecocriticism. If innovation
         in literary theory requires collaboration and exchange of knowledge and practices
         across a broad range of different disciplines – an approach that connects, but is
         not restricted, to the notion of ›travelling concepts‹ (Bal 2002) –, what is gained
         by a new emphasis on ›networks‹ and ›network theory‹ (in opposition to, or in connection
         with, approaching literature and literary theory as ›discourse‹, ›field‹, or ›system‹)?
      </p>
      <p class="No Spacing">Contributions might address (but are not limited to) the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
         <li class="item">To what extent can new modes of network analysis advance literary theory?</li>
         <li class="item">How does ›network theory‹ connect to and exceed more established transdisciplinary
            approaches or frameworks based, for instance, on ›intersectionality‹ or ›travelling
            concepts‹?
         </li>
         <li class="item">What are the new geographies of scholarship and novel »trading zones« that emerge
            from networked approaches which draw on »interactional expertise« (Ahnert 2020, 91)?
         </li>
         <li class="item">What are (conceptual) nodes and edges that define connections within networks that
            can be used to explain (historical) trends and developments in literatures and how
            can these be theorized?
         </li>
         <li class="item">What is the specific gain of approaching literature and literary texts as networks?</li>
         <li class="item">What are the methodological tools required for a networked approach in literary studies;
            what challenges and obstacles arise; and how can they be solved, overcome, or, if
            causing necessary and productive frictions, sustained?
         </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="No Spacing">JLT aims to publish work on fundamental issues in methodology and the construction
         of theories and concepts, as well as articles on particular literary theories. Case
         studies, i.e. studies on specific authors, works, or problems of literary history,
         are accepted only if they adopt a predominantly systematic perspective, contribute
         to the reconstruction of the history of literary theory, or pursue innovative methods.
         Moreover, the Journal of Literary Theory contains work reviewing and outlining trends
         of theoretical debates in literary theory and related disciplines.

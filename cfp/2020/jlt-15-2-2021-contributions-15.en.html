      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The proximity of most cultural studies and humanities to more or less radical forms
         of constructivism is accompanied by a fundamental skepticism towards generic concepts
         that purpote to accurately describe something beyond the individual. In literary studies,
         for example, this applies to the terms ›period‹ and ›genre‹ as well as to individual
         terms for periods and genres. On the one hand, such terms have remained indispensable
         structuring devices, while on the other hand they appear to many to be usable only
         in didactic contexts. This skepticism is encouraged by an interest in the individual
         and uniquely successful work of art, which seems to resist a ›subordination‹ to concepts.
         In their practical application, a discrepancy becomes apparent between theoretical
         demands on concepts and their definition on the one hand and the often confusing and
         sometimes even inconsistent conditions of application that are due to the historically
         variable subject matter on the other. This has various consequences: Many contributions
         dedicated to the elucidation of a concept state that it is particularly difficult,
         if not impossible, to define it. Additionally, it is often claimed that terms of period
         and genre are always ›hybrid‹ or ›mixed‹. At the same time, however, lists of defining
         characteristics for literary genres or subgenres are used, most notably in textbooks.
         Praxeological studies also show that concepts are employed differently in literary
         studies relative to their context of use and objective: While, for example, in literary
         history a particular generic concept (›realism‹) is frequently used as a matter of
         course in order to incorporate a number of literary texts, once an individual text
         is at stake the need arises to combine several such concepts in order to do justice
         to its individual interpretive features. – Based on these observations, JLT issue
         15/2 will be devoted to the formation of terms in literary studies and history.
      </p>
      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">The following topics and aspects could be covered:</p>
      <ul>
         <li class="item"><span style="font-style:italic">Strategies of concept formation appropriate to literature and literary history</span>: What are the advantages and problems of e.g. classical feature-based procedures,
            what are the advantages and problems of approaches that work with family resemblance
            or prototypes? Is there recent research on forms of conceptualization that is of interest
            for the purposes of literary studies?
         </li>
         <li class="item"><span style="font-style:italic">Relationship between historical and descriptive concepts</span>: Genre theorists have pointed out that a clear distinction should be made between
            historical concepts and their reconstruction in descriptive language. However, this
            is rarely consistently considered in the practice of literary studies. What is the
            reason for this? Is there no problem here at all? Would more complex solutions have
            to be developed? Are there different restrictions in different cultures of literary
            studies concerning the types of terms for which the distinction must be taken into
            account (e.g. terms for the classification of genres vs. terms for the classification
            of character behavior)?

                       p. -->Aesthetic theory and literary concepts</span>: Are there aspects of literary works that resist conceptual representation?
         </li>
         <li class="item"><span style="font-style:italic">Concept formation and empirical analysis</span>, e.g. in the psychology of literary reception or in digital literary analysis: Can
            the results of empirical analysis augment or correct concepts that have been defined
            in literary studies by way of traditional methods?
         </li>
         <li class="item"><span style="font-style:italic">Conceptual politics</span>: Is it central, when using and introducing concepts, to consider the interests are
            thereby reflected, reinforced, or disadvantaged?
         </li>
         <li class="item"><span style="font-style:italic">Praxeological studies</span> on the way specific terms are used in literary studies: What functions do these concepts
            have? What functions do the different meta-linguistic statements about concepts have
            (from the rigorously established postulate of clarity to the topically expressed skepticism
            towards terminological definitions)?
         </li>

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">We encourage submissions by scholars from all fields of literary studies as well as
         neighbouring disciplines, e.g. the philosophy of art, media studies, art history,
         and musicology. Articles in which individual literary texts or a corpus of literary
         texts are interpreted can only be considered if they feature a strong focus on systematic
         and theoretical questions.

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">Contributions should not exceed 50,000 characters in length and have to be submitted

      <p class="pdf_RezJLT_Haupttext">JLT aims to publish work on fundamental issues in methodology and the construction
         of theories and concepts, as well as articles on particular literary theories. Case
         studies, i.e. studies on specific authors, works, or problems of literary history,
         are accepted only if they adopt a predominantly systematic perspective, contribute
         to the reconstruction of the history of literary theory, or pursue innovative methods.
         Moreover, the Journal of Literary Theory contains work reviewing and outlining trends
         of theoretical debates in literary theory and related disciplines.
